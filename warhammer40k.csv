"PSA for new players: Do not play your first game against a competitive player: Long story short, I lost all interest in Warhammer Underworlds for this very reason. The whole point of the first game is to figure out what excites you about the game, and that isn't going to happen if the other guy gets his kicks from brutally min maxing every aspect of his army, faction, or deck. It may be a little more work, but find other new players to play with. It will be a lot more rewarding."

I'm only sharing what I can remember but it was packed! I will definitely be going back! They also had tons of tables and terrain available for use. As a bonus they had one of the largest Board Game selections I have seen in person. Loved it.Moral of the story, don't limit yourself to where you shop just out of laziness or comfort. It only took a 20 minute drive across town and there was another place I could easily support before going online."

"Worth buying regular marines?: Im not a fan of the lore behind the primaris marines, so I don‚Äôt really want to buy any. Even the faction that I want to play (Dark Angels), at least from the lore I read on 1d4chan don‚Äôt like them either, making me want to buy them even less. However is it really worth buying the regular marines if they‚Äôre just gonna get phased out in a few years?"

We're looking for youtube videos, websites, streams and of course the wisdom of people more involved in the hobby than us.We would like to thank everyone in advance, and we're looking forward to your responses!Ps: Sorry for any mistakes since english is not my primary language."

"Any experience with the new Technical: Stormshield?: I have been using a satin varnish (Winsor &amp; Newton spray varnish) lately for my models, especially my space marines, as I like the idea of the power armor having that slight (but not intense) shine to it.  The varnish goes on beautifully, doesn't discolor, and seems to protect really well.However, I don't want all of my model to be satin.  I want things like cloth and parchment to be matte.  Plus my base, which I want to be matte and not the same satin.  I grabbed some Stormshield yesterday, understanding it to be the matte version of 'Ardcoat.  I expected I'd be able to apply it over the satin varnish and it would remove the shine.Unfortunately, that didn't work; still has that satiny shine where I applied the Stormshield.  Even after a few coats.  Is there something I'm missing?  Or maybe Stormshield isn't as matte as I understood it to be?  I wonder if the varnish I'm using it somehow ""too strong""; even Dullcote sprayed over my tyranids after I apply the satin varnish doesn't seem to actually dull the way I remember it."

Also I've heard that Drukari might be a difficult army for new players to start out with due to being glass cannons. Should I continue building my Death Guard army up to 2000 points or go down the  dark webway and start building up an army from the Kabals of Commorragh?

I picked up a Space Marine codex as they interested me and I wanted to see their lore and rules. For the last few days I've been reading lore nonstop, and this is where I currently am.Space Marines: Awesome lore, and I love the chapter variety. I'm considering playing Salamanders or Iron Hands, although they don't have much support from GW. VULKAN LIVESAdMech: My favorite looking models in the game. The big thing stopping me from playing them is that they seem hard to paint.Necrons: Awesome lore, but I know they're kind of bad in game. I don't need a top tier army, but I want something I can win with.Astra Militarum: I love the idea of the guard and all their regiments, but I don't want to play Cadians or Catachan and I'm not confident enough to convert models.Thousand Sons: Probably the only chaod army I would play, they just seen hard to paint and kind of expensive.I realize you can't give me a definite answer, but and insight or advice would be much appreciated.

Wraithbone Base Paint Issues: I tend to spray the majority of my models while they are still on the sprue and at the moment I‚Äôm having a play around with Contrast Paints to see what I can do with them. The Wraithbone spray is fine and I have no issues with that. I bought a pot of the Wraithbone Base paint the other day to touch up those points on the model where they were attached to the sprue. It has the consistency of the GW yellow paints from the 1980s and 1990s. It‚Äôs very runny as though the thickening agent like cornflour wasn‚Äôt added. I tested it on a model and it took three coats to get anywhere near a basic flat colour and that was over a metallic. I tried it on bare plastic this morning and it just pooled in the recesses. I‚Äôm assuming this isn‚Äôt normal as I have other GW base paints and they do not do this. Has any one had similar issues or advice for thickening it?I‚Äôm probably going back to the GW store after work today and exchange it for another to be honest.

What do you do when something like this happens? Do you immediately reposition your models after taking the casualty so that everyone is within two inches of each other again or do you simply not deal with it until the next time you move that unit?"

Knights with either a Valiant or a Castellan, and I'd likely replace the Paladin.The question is, what Dominus should I take for what purpose - the Castellan has better ranged coverage, but the price point puts me off. On the other hand, the Valiant's shorter range gives me the impression that it might be more vulnerable close up, and I'm not entirely sure how to manage that.Could I please get some tips on what to do, as I am not sure due to having no experience with Dominus Knights..."

"Average imperial guardsmen: Why are they the poorest and weakest basic soldiers out there? I mean, I know from a lore standpoint, they are meant to have numbers, but thinking this logically, the imperium is supposed to have better tech than The T‚Äôau(right?) so then why is a Fire warrior superior to a guardsmen in a fight(I‚Äôm referring to range combat). Doesn‚Äôt the imperium have the tech to prepare guardsmen and equip them better? If they have better tech, or the same, shouldn‚Äôt they , for example , create weapons similar to Tau pulse weapons? I‚Äôm seriously asking, or about their Flak armor, they really can‚Äôt equip them with carapace armor? Lore wise, the numbers are the problem, right? And lastly, even against an Eldar guardian. I know eldar are faster and have better reflexes than humans, but aren‚Äôt humans physically stronger? Experience is obviously in the eldar‚Äôs favor, but I guess if the Guardsmen would train from birth , that would mean like 20-30 years of training? That is nothing compared to the eldar, right? So basically, the imperium really doesn‚Äôt have the tech to equip their soldiers like the T‚Äôau do? Thanks"
"What are your Dream Armies?: Lay out your dream armies, you have infinite money to buy models with. What would you get? What would the composition of the army be? What faction? Lay it out, because I love making armies, and I am sure others do as well, epically before your first game with an army."
"Eternal Crusade: Eldar players?: So, I downloaded the game because it was free, to a point. It's basically PVE with 'nids (with pvp against other factions if you pay for it).

"Can you havw a good time playing Necrons currently?: I've been into 40k for about a year. I have a Space Marine army and I'm starting some Tyranids. I know a bit about how a lot of factions play but all I know about Necrons really is that they're not in a great spot right now competitively. Iirc a lot of their stuff is severely overcosted due to reanimation protocols, which rarely helps much because it isn't too difficult to wipe entire units.My brother wants to get into the hobby and he really likes Necrons. He's also considering Tau and CSM/Demons but seems mostly interested in Necrons. I want to encourage him to build and play with what he likes best, but I also don't want him to get smashed at the local store and start disliking the game. How bad really are Necrons? Is it gonna be a bad time most of the time, or is it really only in the competitive scene that they struggle? Also, How do they stack up in Kill Team vs full scale 40k?"

My next army I start, I want it to fit my playstyle better so I enjoy games more.I want to play an army that has access to a large amount of weird options and combinations, and generally feels ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô to building a typical gunline or charge into melee army.As an example of stuff that fits my playstyle in OTHER games:Dota2 - RubickMagic the gathering EDH - CromatIf you don‚Äôt know what either of those are, they‚Äôre essentially things with lots of in-game flexibility.Also, I don‚Äôt really feel like playing ‚Äògood guy‚Äô armies such as Imperium, Eldar, and Tau. Our meta is stuffed with them, and I want my new army to be a pleasant surprise/breath of fresh air to our group later.Armies that came to mind for me are Genestealers (having bizarre/unique ways to compose armies), and maybe Word Bearers (Since they specialize in summoning variety demons mid game)I really do want to try getting that feeling right next time.

WIP. The armour is too shiny for the camera: 
"Aspect Warrior efficiency: So off of the tabletop soldiers of different factions are scaled much differently. Space marines are gods of combat and could take on ridiculous numbers of guardsmen on their own, in all likelihood. Made me start thinking, how good are aspect warriors in the lore? Because of their dire population problems you hear about them winning large battles with only a couple if any casualties. Does that mean they‚Äôre close to space marines in relative prowess? Or are they lesser and their low casualties are more a product of superior tactics and maneuvering (read: precognitive warlords). I‚Äôve read things about them being ridiculously fast, so I‚Äôm sure that contributes to them being dangerous but are they fast enough to be a real danger or equal to a marine?I guess what I‚Äôm trying to ask is, if a marine is worth X number of guard, are aspect warriors equal to more, less, or equal to X number of guard.PS. I know each aspect is very different so let‚Äôs just say an avenger for ranged and a banshee for melee."
Death Guard help: I need the help of the hivemind. I'm close to expanding my DG collection from two Dark Imperium boxes. I love the grinding advance that the DG can do with their infantry so I was thinking of getting 3 blighthaulers and another 7 plague marines (total 21 then). That way I can run 4 squads of 5 marines with 2 blight launches in each squad. The flip side is 10 blightlord termies because they are OP. I also want an army that is usable.Any thoughts or recommendations? PS I already have Mortarian and thanks in advance :)

Substitute for Bugmans Glow?: Wondering if there are any paints that substitute for Bugmans Glow for my plague marines
"How the Inquisition Could Help 8th Edition: Most agree that 8th edition is fantastic, helping many get back into the game and bringing in new players. A great part of that is the Stratagem system, though there have been issues surrounding CP farms, and it‚Äôs impact on elite armies and souping in general.What if the Inquisition, a popular part of 40k lore but a bit ignored on the tabletop, could fix that?When White Dwarf releases the Assassins Index, they allowed you to spend CP to bring them onto the field, mitigating the need for detachments, and providing access to thematic character hunters.I‚Äôm proposing that Inquisitors could work in a similar way, but providing you with CP bonuses. They could be summoned via Stratagem, and provide bonuses to your overall CP while acting as Army buffing GE Psykers on the field, allowing more elite armies with access to a larger set of CP than we have currently, but without sacrificing those precious points on the loyal 32. The main downside would be that it could provide already potent horde armies with even more, though with the FAQs to stratagem usage, they‚Äôre quite redundant after a certain point. But elite armies like Grey Knights and Custodians struggle to compete with the horde armies in the amount of stratagems they can use, and this could help fill that gap.It would also help mono faction builds, as the army wouldn‚Äôt have access to multiple faction stratagems by filling their armies with cheap units for CP. while this would fulfil a similar role, the lore for the Inquisition is that they‚Äôre always involved!Their retinues could be an additional stratagem, that allows them to have thematic bodyguards.Let me know what your thoughts are! I‚Äôm by no means an expert, but I like inquisitors and thought this could be an interesting take!"

"My unpopular opinion: many players seem almost afraid of making their list ""too competitive"" for fear of being negatively labelled as ""win at all costs"". People should be building their armies with more teeth.: Communication before a game is ideal. If I know my oponent is going to be bringing a less competitive and more fluffy list then I will try to do the same and I've had some great fun with this. But it gets a bit old and I have noticed a theme of players announcing their list is ""not competitive"" or worse ""only semi-competitive"" in local tournaments almost as an excuse for losing before games even begin. As an oponent this sucks because steam rolling someone who knowingly avoids their faction's best units is pointless. Build lists with teeth and have more fun?"

"Pressure to put in 110%: One of my favorite armies is the Night Lords, their lore and look are just awesome and they're part of what got me into the hobby. But I always feel that theres this pressure to make a 'true' Night Lords army; no marks or daemons, very few chaos-y bits like armor mouths, and any units that are inherently tainted like berserkers, Obliterators, Helbrutes, etc. need to be converted or counts-as to fit in with the neutral stance I see the Night Lords taking on that topic. But its intimidating. I've not tried sculpting green stuff or doing intricate conversions, just part swaps really, so I always feel I'm not doing the army justice essentially. Any words of advice to give me? I know it just needs to be fun for me and there are plenty of ways to do this stuff, but sometimes it can be a little much.Tl:dr Any advice for a novice hobbyist/player looking to make a good Night Lords force?"

Primares world eater :): 
I have this crazy idea and I need your help: Iam thinking about this now for a long time but iam not sure how to start. Also iam pretty new to the whole hobby and so everything is more or less new to me. As a Tau player I have probably magnetized all my suits so of course I have a lot of secondary equip and no good place to keep them so I had this crazy idea to scratch build some sort of hangar for the stuff but that's where my problems start. Also I want to store my Riptide and Ghostkeel weapons so the thing will be huge it should setting and Lore wise big enough to house these both suits. First iam not sure how to design the building from inside and outside as there is little artworks with tau buildings and a lot less with interiors from Tau buildings. So I need the knowledge of the community. If you have pictures or artworks of this stuff I would be really happy. Second iam not sure what material to use. So this question is probably one for the terrain and sceneric builders.I know this really ambitious and probably really stupid but I can't get it out of my mind so I disturb you guys with it and also the community was really helpful so far so thanks to you guys in general! :)

"A Necron Rant: When I first got into the hobby, I read somewhere about a squad of imperial guard hunkering down in some quickly constructed fortified positions on a city street. They didnt know what they were fighting as that knowledge would get a bolt through the head. The sergeant hears over the comms for the missle launcher team to open fire on an incoming enemy force directly in front of them. The rocket flys overhead and collides into the side of the building. Debris and smoke cuts across the street and the seargent couldnt see five feet in front of him. Silence fills the air before they start hearing the march of metallic footsteps. Time seem to slow before the glowing green eyes of the Necrons appeared through the dust. They halted all at once, pointed their bizarre weaponry and let loose a storm of green lightning that reduced everything to ash. They made no sound as they killed. Only the crack of their weapons pierced the air. I. Was. Hooked. That is what I loved about the Necrons. They were this beautifully constructed grim-dark army that even their rules back then (kill everything on a 6, reanimate, dissapear mysteriously if the army is reduced by half). They were an unknown, deadly and silent force. The next codex they brought their gameplay to pants tightening levels of fun (mindshackle scarabs, the formation where everything reanimates on a 4(?) up, Scarabs are the best tank killers in the game, MONOLITHS) You brought fear with you when you played Necrons. But.....the lore changed. At first I didnt really notice it because at that time how the lore was and how they played were not quite the same. But it was something I noticed that kept niggling in the back of my mind. This was a race that is enslaved by actual gods. Before there were shards of the C'tan, they were the actual C'tan. You think the Nightbringer is spooky now? Look back a few editions when if you were a certain toughness (4?) below he could literally blow your squad away and if you hit terrain as you flew away YOU HAD A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF STRAIGHT UP DYING.  The Deciever? Still kond of the same today but even more trolly back then. But then they were shattered. Today they are still ok gameplay wise but when the lore started to catch up with the Necrons on how they played it felt different. They started to feel rather cartoony like a mixture between Skeltor and Transformers.  When Immotekh was released he was disappointing. Before you grumble think about this. A Necron Lord could go toe to toe with a Space Marine captain with ease. An Overlord could take on Chapter Masters. Hell, in the Necron black book codex when a Lord was on the field it took everything to put it down in the lore. A Phaeron? An entity that has been alive for millions of years that should be classed with the best wargear and tactical mind that dynasty has to offer? Should not be a dissappointment. It should be on the level of Primarchs.But Im getting ahead of myself. What I was hopping for when the Necrons were getting an updated rulebook from.their black book was more  of the same ""We are Legion. We are Death."" But the feel I'm getting is just Space Marine chapters with minor tweaks. I toyed with the idea of them having cults for each of the remaining C'tan, but that felt a little too much like Chaos. But lo and behold! Forgeworld answers my prayers with the Maynarkh dynasty! That book is still a joy to read. The idea of an entire system blackout and when the Imperial fleets recieve a transmission its filled with screams of the tortured screams of the dying with the simple message ""Maynarkh comes"" MAKES. ME. MOIST. An entry where a seargent, while being interviewed by one of his commanders, dies because his heart explodes in fear from just the MEMORY of witnessing Kutlekh? Oh lord take me.  This! This is the old Necrons I used to adore! Oh you want Charnel Gaurd that albeit more expensive than Lychgaurd but are genuine executionars when your Overlord cant be bothered? You want special rule sets for the slow decaying, mind-breaking madness that grips this legion in its ever tightning fist? You want Flayers for troops? You want a a warlord named the freaking World Killer that actually lives up to his namesake? This is where you went.And then 8th dropped. And Maynarkh was lost. Look Im trying not to sound like a winging neckbeard. GW has done some great things recently like the treatment for Chaos and making Drukhari play like Drukhari and a host of other examples. But if GW can make Gaurd, Tau, Mechanicus, Drukhari, Aeldari, Orks and Custodians fight how they do in the lore, then I believe the same love and attention need to be paid to Necrons, Chaos, and Space Marines. But again, thats just my opinion. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. (P.S. Dont get me started on why they got rid of Pariahs for no good reason. I will be here forever ranting about that.)"

Bladed Cog Blue/Teal - Instructions in Comments: 
"Need help with game and Adeptus Custodies rules: So i have been playing a custodies army consisting of one guard squad, 2 terminators and a squad of wardens and have got a bunch of questions regarding base game rules and custodies specific rules. 1. So the base game stuff. I was under the impression that units could overwatch every time they are charged as long as they are not already in melee combat, however watched a video that said each unit can only overwatch once per unit? 2. When units are locked in melee combat can they be shot at by units out of melee? 3. Do all captain and Vexilla models move separate from the rest of the squad they came with. Ie, 3 terminators, one as a captain and one as a vex, one normal. Do they all move individually or have to stay as a unit?5. If the answer to the previous question is that they are separate units, what happens to the last normal terminator from the box. 6. If a guard squad has only one storm shield, does the entire unit get the 3+ invulnerable save? 7. More of a preference question, axe or spear. I have been using spears as I‚Äôm mainly against infantry armies meaning that most of the axe melee rolls would be 2+, wound 5+, (followed by a 6+ because I‚Äôm normally against imperial fist) compared to my current 2+ hit, 6+ wound (and 6+ imperial fist chapter tactic). What would you use in this situation? 8. Then following from the previous question, any tips on changing weapons and arms (and removing shoulder pads) without causing noticeable damage to the models? I have used citadel plastic glue which complicates things!  Thanks!"

"Space Bear, non-canon fluff idea: I love, love, love space wolves and their lore, and I had a fun non-canon concept for a 'successor-chapter' (yes, I know they haven't been able to make any due to the wulfen curse).The idea has it that the reason successor chapters succumb to mutation and the wulfen, is that the canis helix requires the world-soul of Fenris to be kept in check.  I have a fluff idea where other Neolithic planets with Apex Super-Predators (like a bear or a lion) could be used as the source of a successor chapter using a DNA cocktial from that planets ecosystem. IE an Ursus Helix.  Thus, the successor chapter is tied to the world-soul of the new home planet and unaffected by the wulfen curse (though they'd have their own equivalent).Thoughts? I'd love to hear what y'all think of this fluff concept.  I might write or draw it out if it gets traction."

"Finally getting started!: So back in 2017 I made a post about me joining the warhammer 40k tabletop game/hobby and making my first army of iron hands but I never got around to buying anything. Thankfully am glad to announce that I just purchased my first tactical squad of space marines from amazon! Primarily the reasoning on why I waited so long was because of cost of the miniatures and paints. Another thing that kinda made me hesitant on buying them was the painting of the miniatures themselves, I was never a good at drawing and never grew up painting either so I thought to myself since I wasn‚Äôt able to do those things i probably won‚Äôt be able to paint these miniatures either but after watching a YouTuber called ‚ÄúTheApatheicFish‚Äù and other YouTubers, they showed me that it isn‚Äôt that bad  on painting miniatures and besides, why not try at the least right? For sure though the first army that I‚Äôll be making will still be iron hands chapter! I bought 14 citadel paints with a model tool kit and with the tactical squad I bought I spent a little over $100 on it all and if everything works out with the tactical squad my next purchase will most definitely be a devastator squad. Still don‚Äôt know much of the game but I‚Äôll get around to understanding it one hopefully. My question is how do I make my iron hands more ‚Äúcybernetic‚Äù looking? I see really cool looking iron hand miniatures with awesome looking cybernetics but I can‚Äôt find those parts anywhere besides the iron hand tactical squad upgrade pack that games workshop sells (which I‚Äôll most definitely will be buying at a later date). The tactical squad I bought:https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00EWOMU8U?ref=ppx_pt2_mob_b_prod_imageThe molding kit:https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01GH6B3Z6?ref=ppx_pt2_mob_b_prod_imageThe paints I bought were: Abbadon black, Dark Reaper, Thunderhawk blue, Administratum grey, Leadbelcher, Iron breaker, Runefang steel, Celestra grey, Ulthuan grey, White scar, Khorne Red, Wazdakka Red, Troll slayer orange, Drakenhof nightshade."

"Home-brewing a Chapter, Collaborating with a friend, Seeking advise!: Me and one of my friends are getting into 40k, and I've decided to start building a Dark Angels Successor Chapter, and a Imperial Guard Regiment. I am a big fan of lore in these kinds of things, so I've pushed us to work on lore for our forces. We've been sharing ideas about it for the past few weeks and I'm looking for some advice/input on ideas I have for my factions!&amp;#x200B;The small cluster of solar systems our factions inhabit include my factions' system, the Caligador system. The solar system holds 5 worlds, two are habitable, a agri-world, and a hive world.&amp;#x200B;Lore starts when the Imperium colonizes the system at some point before M37, where the agri-world uses it's food to help support the industrious young hive world. That being said, with few defense forces protecting these resources, the system governor founds ""The Scythes of Caligador"" regiment, directly conscripting people from both the Agri, and Hive world.&amp;#x200B;After a short review of the system's military, judges from the Adeptus Mechanicus deemed the efforts of the system's Governor lacking. Leaving the system with no additional forces would be too risky, jeopardizing the already established Imperial efforts here, as well as facing the possible loss of a launching point for future expansion in the cluster. Seeing this, they proposed the Hive World be used to found a Space Marine Chapter.&amp;#x200B;The Dark Angels successor chapter, The Black Spears, would be founding late in M37 during the 23rd founding, and sent to Caligador to build up their forces and defend the system before joining future crusades. The Chaptermaster would be briefed by the Inner Circle, that there was suspected Fallen in the region, and the chapter's hidden goal was to uproot them, and bring them back to The Rock quietly. Over the following years, the chapter would build it's strength, all while undertaking the secret mission given to them.&amp;#x200B;Things come to a head when they learn that high ranking members of the local Ecclesiarchy were part of a chaos cult, and were under the leadership of a small group of the Fallen. Before The Black Spears were able to make their move, the cult completed a ritual, causing warp storms to cut off the system from the rest of the Imperium. Needless to say, a long civil war was carried out, which ended in The Black Spears eradicating the Ecclesiarchy's presence in the system, and the Fallen fleeing before being captured.&amp;#x200B;With the damage done, The system was now cut off from the Imperium due to the warp storms. The Chaptermaster soon seizes full control of the system, and now directs the chapter to continue building up arms and forces. Diverging from the Codex, the Chapter goes on to create an additional 3 companies of marines during this isolation.&amp;#x200B;The warp storms would eventually subside, allowing Caligador to reunite with the rest of the Imperium. One of the first contacts The Black Spears have with the Imperium is when they receive a summons from Supreme Grandmaster Azrael to the Rock. They accept and arrive, but they are soon interrupted by the arrival of the Primarch, Guilleman, who hosts a summit, distributing Primaris marines to the Unforgiven Chapters (as stated here: [https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Dark\_Angels](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Angels) under the section titled ""The Primarch's Summit and the Primaris Unforgiven"") . These reinforcements would be used to create a additional 2 companies of exclusively Primaris Marines for The Black Spears, while also integrating some into other companiesl.&amp;#x200B;I just wanted to add a few questions here at the end. What other effects do warp storms have, other than cutting off systems from travel? Would that increase attacks from chaos based enemies? And since this is a Dark Angels successor chapter, would they need to use the standard Space Marine codex rules in the game, or have access to the Dark Angels Codex, sharing their stats as well?[\(Standard Astartes Space Marine\)](https://i.redd.it/zuy96u1buu731.jpg)[\(Primaris Space Marines\)](https://i.redd.it/j6a4ju1buu731.jpg)"

"Abaddon The Despoiler punched to death by Captain Acheran of the Ultramarine‚Äôs 2nd Company: A lot of people criticise the Phobos Captain but today he showed his worth.I spent the previous turns firing upon the horde of Black Legion in a static position. The attack was unexpected, so advanced weaponry was not present. Just a bunch of Bolt Carbines.By the time the Warlord had arrived at my gunline, his fleet had fallen. He charged into a squad of Infiltrators who happily gave their lives for a chance at glory in killing the Imperium‚Äôs most hated adversary. The remaining Infiltrators piled in and wounded him but once. Next turn, the Infiltrators fell back allowing the mere reconnaissance detachment to fire into the Warlord. All fire and even Psychic attacks were ineffective, so the Ultramarines threw down their Wargear and charged at Abaddon headfirst. His hurried fire bounced from the remaining Infiltrators as Captain Acheran, Librarian Maltis, the Sergeant and remaining Infiltrators surrounded Abaddon.Three wounds from the Infiltrators with Might of Heroes boosted strength. Three wounds from Maltis‚Äô force sword, crackling with potent Warp energy. One final swing was hit by Captain Acheran and Abaddon fell to his knees.Truly a great day for the Imperium of Man. I can feel the Emperor smile upon us Ultramarines today!"

"Scrapcode - how it works, possible mitigation strategies (Analysis): Scrapcode: Chaos-based software virus that can infect a very wide range of machinery, taking it to Chaos control.  Often spreads as a worm, copying itself across a weak network.  Scrambles internal data flow, creating a disorderly state in which the Machine Spirit can be edited into a Chaos agent.  Originates from Scrapcode Generators (SCG).Computer viruses depend on vulnerabilities, or bugs, ways the target software is written that allow unauthorized actions.  They do this by including an exploit, a code script that accesses said system through that vulnerability.  Once inside Scrapcode would then deliver its Chaotic payload, possibly by running Dark Tongue phrases that attract Warp energy to the target machine.As Scrapcode is Warp-based it would seem mitigation requires Immaterial means.  That Chaos followers broadcast Scrapcode in battle or upload it to enemy IT networks infers it requires access to targeted systems, exploiting bugs and altering data. While one could theoretically block Scrapcode with bug patching and IT security education, some Dark Tongue based antivirus should also prove useful.  Exploiting a bug raises its public profile, especially if it is used harmfully; the Imperium of Man may patch one in anywhere from a few hours to a few millennia.Scrapcode has a high recorded success rate, infecting even Knights and Titans.  It would be strange if in its many uses across the galaxy Scrapcode encountered mostly software with a specific bug or set of bugs.  It seems more likely that Scrapcode includes a ‚Äúfuzzing‚Äù scanner that finds new bugs and reports them to the SCG where a weak AI or Warp Daemon tailors exploits it then updates to all copies of Scrapcode.  This would also explain why Scrapcode uses that specific device despite the physical vulnerability it gives.  More SCGs means more rapid hacking.  Nonetheless Scrapcode has met certain limits; during the Schism of Mars (005-006.M31) it failed to infect the at the time new, securely designed Noosphere.  For the newly updated Scrapcode to fail again one should fight and patch, not merely hope and pray.Any feedback?  Further ideas?"

A navigator.: 
"Regarding cover in 8th edition: So for woods and ruins, in the advanced rules section of the rulebook, both contain a sentence which states:&amp;#x200B;""Infantry units that are entirely on the base of a wood/are on a ruin receive the benefit of cover ... **Other units only receive the benefit of cover if at least 50% of every model is actually obscured from the point of view of the shooting unit.**""&amp;#x200B;The way I'm reading this is ""other units"", meaning non-infantry **and** units *not* entirely (or not at all) on the base of the cover receive the benefit of cover if the entire unit is at least 50% obscured from the firing model. So you would receive cover if the shooter had to target your unit through a wood and they could only see 50% or less of each model.&amp;#x200B;The way this is worded is vague. Is ""other units"" just referring to non-infantry units on or partially on cover, or is it also referring to units which aren't on the cover? I think with RAW, it could be interpreted as either.&amp;#x200B;I've been playing with the way I outlined, as it makes sense to me like this as well:Why would a unit on a wood receive cover if it was just as obscured from the shooter, but closer; though it wouldn't if it was equally obscured by the terrain feature and *farther away*?"

How do you use this: 
"A Bit Of A Rant About 8th: I really loved 8th edition when it launched. It felt streamlined but not dumbed down, it seemed to encourage diverse army builds and I was encouraged that GW were paying more attention to balance. But now I'm starting to lose the faith.&amp;#x200B;Everything just feels too powerful now, there are so many guns with multiple damage and high rate of fire that things like Space Marines with lower model counts just die in droves. Maybe three quarters of my games are realistically over by the end of turn two, in either player's favour. The game encourages low mobility armies that just blow you away in a couple of shooting phases or it makes factions like Orks, GSC , Harlequins etc. that can basically end the game turn 1 in close combat. It just feels gamebreaking to have these armies utterly decimate you with almost guaranteed turn 1 charges. Anything that doesn't fall into those 2 camps generally gets destroyed.&amp;#x200B;And mortal wounds... Remember when they tried to claim they'd be rare? They are so easily spammable and ignore so many of the game's core mechanics that you may as well be shooting dice in an alleyway rather than playing a wargame. &amp;#x200B;I dunno. I want to like 40k (I've been into it since the early days of 3rd), but the games I play just aren't fun any more. It's literally just ""whoever has the new hotness wins."" I've tried mitigating this with the Chapter Approved missions but they don't matter when either me or my opponent has nothing left to score objectives in a couple of turns.&amp;#x200B;Is anyone else facing a similar burnout?"

Making for 4 attackes per fight phase3 at STR6, 1 at STR5 per unitThen phase 2 begins exactly the same making for a total of 8 attacks per unit.6 at STR6 and 2 at STR5 per unit = Making for 80 attacks per 10 man squad.Is this true or am I mistaken somewhere."

"Sell me on Primaris: To put it bluntly, Primaris are ruining the setting for me. I think most of their models are pretty good and some of their units look like fun to play on the tabletop but I just can't forgive their fluff.To me, the 40k is exemplified by the lore from 3rd edition - 6th edition. By the gritty, terrifying artwork of John Blanche. It's about the final crescendo of a rotten universe, doomed to be consumed by laughing gods.Then GW decided to put a virtuous hero in charge of the Imperium instead of the corrupt bureaucrats who had been in charge previously. They decided to disregard the themes of stagnation within the Imperium and have a newcomer invent a breed of space marines who are better in every way with zero downsides or repercussions.I don't want to hate the primaris lore like I do, I wish I could love them and enjoy all the new content GW is putting out surrounding them.This is where you come in. What is it about Primaris that you enjoy? Try to sell me on them. Change my view, as it were."

"Chaos Keyword Question: Sorry if this is a common post or in the wrong sub. I have heard conflicting reports on this topic, so I was hoping for a definitive answer.If a unit with an aura buff like Changecaster/Plaguebringer/Bloodmaster Locus abilities says it effects &lt;CHAOS GOD&gt; DAEMONS, does that mean it works on anything with both the &lt;MARK OF CHAOS&gt; and &lt;DAEMON&gt; keywords? Or do they require a specific single keyword?Basically, would a Herald of Slaanesh increase the Strength of a nearby CSM Venomcrawler with the Mark of Slaanesh? Would The Changeling give my Thousand Sons Defiler a 6+ Feel No Pain save?Thanks in advance for the help!"

What Now for the Corsairs?: 
"The Progressive And Honestly Incredible Portrayal of Sexuality In Orks.: In 40k, all orks are seen as 'boys', despite having no genderr. now me, as a 'boy' love to fight and destroy things. This however is a masculine trait which also coincidies with the idea of being a 'boy'. While it would've been ideal for GW to just call them 'greens' or 'mongos' instead of a word that implies gender, i do find it very fitting and progrsssvie of gams workshop to give them all the same traits and implications for their sexual identities that they do not have or do. My entire belief of the orks is that they are a people who live off of war and excess, however this cannot be blame don toxic masculity due to the entire race being toxicly masculine. It is a clever parody of our own testosterone filled existences and therefore, our society and culture.  If orks were calls 'gals' i hav eno doubt they'd spend their time wearing minskirts, throwing tantrums and getting periods. It's a clear parody on our gender and i applaud games workshop for being so bold.&amp;#x200B;Praise Gork and Mork, the progressive gods of 40k."

"Does sticky tape work well for straight lines?: I want to paint a perfectly straight border on the interior of a cloak and I just can't get it straight enough freehand.I, just wanted to know whether putting a couple of bits of sticky tape on it with a gap between, painting it so the gap creates a straight line, then removing the tape is a technique that works?Does the tape tear off the existing paint?

"Advice of beating Nids as Marines: Fairly self explanatory. I'd love some tips on how to counter Tyranids (Kraken) as a Marine (Ultras) player. I play a mate of mine every few weeks or so. He's gone 4-0 with his Nids.Generally speaking, he runs:\- a Broodlord/Genestealer blob\- a Flyrant/Gargoyles bomb which he drops with a Trygon Prime\-  Hive Guard w Impaler Cannons hiding in cover in his back lineHe also runs a Neurothrope which he also hides in cover, standard gaunt screen, and a Tyrannofex - all of which I've managed to deal with quite well. He drops the Flyrant/Gargoyles/Trygon bomb close by where he runs his Broodlord/Genestealer blob and hits me all in one go. I've rarely been able to recover from that. And I never get close to his Hive Guard.I generally castle up with a Captain/Lieutenant, Tri-Las Pred, Missile Launcher Devastators. Tactical Marines as a screen. Contemptor Dreadnought and Ironclad Dreadnought for counter punch. Vanguard Vets (either with jump-packs or Assault Cannon Razorback) for a bit of flexibility.Any advice or anything I should change?"

"New 17 yr Warhammer 40k fan, I just have a few questions that I‚Äôd love answered!: I have recently gotten myself into the universe Warhammer 40k, and I can‚Äôt seem to get myself out of it! My introduction came from  Space Marine, on Steam, and my interest grew when I played a little of Freeblade on iOS. I have taken a look at the miniatures and the wargame online, and while they look absolutely amazing to collect and play, I don‚Äôt I‚Äôd be able to spend 50 dollars per unit right now. So with that in mind, here are my questions. 1: What are some more digital games you recommend? I looked at Battlefleet Gothic, which looks amazing, so that‚Äôs one. 2. I know there are novels and serialized stories set in the 40k universe, which I‚Äôm going to try to get into, but are there any LORE books? I‚Äôm talking about stuff that‚Äôs written in a non-fiction style, about the fictional universe. 3. (A more nebulous question) I know one of the big draws of the Warhammer 40k universe is it‚Äôs violence and ‚Äúbadassery‚Äù, which is a contributing factor for me, but I also am interested in other reasons why people love 40k. For example, at the core of 40k, for me anyway, is that even though the universe is ‚Äúgrim‚Äù, ‚Äúdark‚Äù, and there is ‚Äúonly war‚Äù, humanity still holds on to itself, and is able to be heroic and strong in sacrifice, duty, and honor. Hopeless war doesn‚Äôt stop us from being selfless. Sorry for the long post, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, ideas and answers!"

Just came in the mail today: 
"Best Introductory 40k themed game for a brand spanking new player?: Trying to get one (possibly more) people into playing 40k games. They have no experience of tabletop war games at all, and I have been out of it for many years. Plenty of models, but I have to get new rulebooks etc.&amp;#x200B;So I see we have 8th edition, kill team, necromunda, blackstone fortress, space marine adventures, space hulk, and im sure a ton more.&amp;#x200B;Easiest to learn/teach is a huge plus.&amp;#x200B;I saw 40k has a really cheap ""first strike"" package that looked neat, but that seemed to have a killteam sized army.

"Is Contrast Worth It?: So I have 2000 pts of Drukhari, a Knight, a few SM things, and some Orks to paint.About 400 pts of the Drukhari are primed and I'm primarily concerned about them and their gray comrades. My original plan was to base spray the gray with Incubi Darkness, then highlight and do details to get to a three color standard. Would Contrast make this process any easier or faster?"
"Opinions on Marine subfactions.: Ive been reading through the book and a bit on battlescribe to find a fun closecombat marine army. I stumbled across the executioners and really like their special rule. Add additional hits on an unmodified roll of 6 in close combat. My list would be High chaplain thulsa kane, 3 units of 10 intercessors to run and gun till they can stab someone, 2 units of 10 assult marines, 5 termies with thunder hammers and 2 librarians, one with a jump pack. How do i make them better up close? Theres ALOT to space marines so I'm definitely missing something I feel. Also I just got back into the game so mechanically I am very fresh."

Primaris marines vs. standard Astartes: I‚Äôm very new to the hobby and really am more focused on the painting side of the hobby versus playing; however I‚Äôve noticed many posts focused on painting and playing entire Primaris marine armies which has me wondering if normal marines are played all that much anymore?

Kitbash Smash Captain: 
"Pile in question: I am very new to 40k and just wanted to ask about piling in.&amp;#x200B;Let's say I have a unit with only 3 models and it's my turn. I charge successfully and pile in, so that all 3 of my models are within 1"" of the nearest enemy unit model (or within 1"" of my central model that is within 1"" of the enemy unit). The enemy unit is aligned in a long thin line, pretty much one in front of another...&amp;#x200B;00     X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X0  My question is firstly, does the opponent get a chance to pile in on my turn? Or only on his turn?Assuming it's the latter, does it mean that the models at the back of his unit cannot attack back in this attack phase? So only 2 of his models are within range so he can only attack with those 2?Then on his turn, he'd want to pile in so that all of his models were in range?This would mean I should try and pile in so that I am out of range of enemy models whenever possible?&amp;#x200B;I think that's how it works but I'm not certain. Any clarification appreciated."
"Asking for tips on where to start!: I started getting into the 40k universe about a month ago and I want to start collecting.

"Is putting Ryza stickers on your tanks really mean i cannot use them as Cadians?: I have painted my army to try and match my SO's mechanicum units, aka a lot of red. Since on the army stickers i got there is ""RYZA"" which is a forge world i choose to apply those to my guard army. I played two 1000 point games tonight at a LGS, i am pretty new coming back to the hobby. The first game went fine and my opponent had no question that i was using them as Cadians. The second game my opponent basically refused to play me at first, because i had Ryza stickers on them and he argued that i cannot use them as Cadians. Since there is no AM rules for Ryza i finally just told him i would play without a regimental doctrine (i ironically won because Mortarion cannot hold every objective on the board alone). When we were done he lectured me on needing to learn how to play a legal army list with legal models. Also he complained about the fact i had spot lights on my tanks, but weren't on my army list (i also never used them, and can't even find them in the codex i thought they were some sort of range finder). Is this really true? Like i get saying this HWT even though has a mortar model it is actually a lascannon. Similarly if i put the dude in my tank hatch does that automatically mean he has to be a tank commander?"

now that the glazes are discontinued - how do I do that ‚Äúalpha legion‚Äù colour: So I do that alpha legion colouring with the glazes guilliman blue and waywatcher green - once I‚Äôve run out how do you recommend achieved the same/similar affect?
"Wraithbone base consistency: I bought a pot of the wraithbone base paint after using grey seer for a while, and the wraithbone is substantially runnier than other bases. It's almost a thick contrast kind of consistency. Is that normal or have I bought a dud pot?"
Finished my retributor astartes helmet today: 
Primaris Wolves Lieutenant: 
W.I.P Emperors Children: 
"My stone crusher carnifex, I'm loving the contrast paint: "
Finally done my kreig reinforcement!: 
Raven Guard Master of Signals for 30k. Being sneaky while calling in an orbital strike.: 
Does it look like a desert camo?: 
Is it a viable option for a Space Marine Terminator Captain to take a relic blade and a storm shield. According to battlescribe it appears I can take the relic blade in replace of a ranged weapon and take a storm shield because it counts as a melee weapon? Is this correct?: 
"In honour of Warhammer Day, I present my first ever painted mini! Lots of room for improvement, but I'm honestly proud of myself.: "
My Fiance's first model. C&amp;C always welcome.: 
Happy Warhammer Day to everyone involved in the hobby!: 
"Warhammer Day Goodies: I've been to Warhammer Day yesterday in a German store  [https://www.chaosbunker.de/en/2019/06/30/warhammer-day-2019-in-koblenz/](https://www.chaosbunker.de/en/2019/06/30/warhammer-day-2019-in-koblenz/)&amp;#x200B;I have seen on Facebook that there seem to be local differences in some of the goodies, beside the pin. Some had framed chapter shoulder pads and more than the regular 5 art cards. What did they have at your store?  Did your store cover something for the Age of Sigmar / WHFB people?"
Latest addition to the necron gang! Had fun trying to make the green gradien. I like this spooky dude üòÖ‚ò†Ô∏è: 
"WIP of the new Sister of Battle model. Still a lot to do, but should be done tomorrow. C+C welcome!: "
Blood Angel's Librarian: 
"What does D3 and D6 mean?: Data sheets say things like roll D3, don‚Äôt understand"
First Ever Model Painted: 
Second model back after a long break any tips or C+C on just how to get better :): 
"Commission Work for a friend , first tank, and a lot of fun !: "
Nice artwork of the Wolfguard cataphractii terminators. Not sure of artist name.: 
My Metal objective markers were a fail from Games Workshop!: 
"Why hasn't GW put out a supplement that standardizes the way people create their own characters, weapons, vehicles yet?: Even though they put out their own models they should understand that their customers want to create their own stuff as well. Rather than seeing outside models as a threat to their own merchandising lines, they should embrace that part of the community through things like a standardized rule set and packaged elements such as stand-alone weapons and weapon parts packs that can be configured into whatever configuration the player can think up. The reality of the WH40K universe is that it is so vast that there would be vehicle and weapon designs from engineers from all over the empire, not just a small handful of standard-issue models like there are now. making a set of creators rules would help avoid the inevitable issues of players arguing about the stat sheets that get made for independently designed models. Just saying, not only would it be relatively simple to write, but they could also get another $20 for selling it, on top of whatever they would pull in from an official GW assortment of parts kits they could come up with."
My First Ever Squad of Space Marines: 
Going for an old-school reference on my renegade hellhound: 
"Replacing Weapons: This is probably a stupid question but I am new to the hobby and have come across a query. When it says you can replace a weapon with another does that mean you subtract the points cost of the weapon you're replacing from the points cost of the weapon you're taking instead. For example, when replacing a Sternguard  veteran's special issue boltgun with a say, a heavy flamer, do you just add the cost of the heavy flamer or do you add the cost of the heavy flamer minus the cost of the special issue boltgun? Hopefully, you people can clear this up, thanks"
Infantry and chimeras advance towards death guard positions: 
I'm normally a filthy xenos player but I figured I would give space marines a try.: 
Can you use the wrong combination of bodies and legs in the ork start collecting box?: I recently got the ork start collecting box and was wondering if you can put together the wrong combination of legs and bodies.
