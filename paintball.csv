Paintball Islamabad: 
"Touching where you got hit to check if it broke, opinions?: I was playing walk on speedball with no refs, just one guy who start/stopped the game. If you call for a paint check it usually takes 20 seconds for somebody to come over and check you. Got hit in the side of the mask so I touch the side of my mask to check if it broke, it did, but immediately after some guy watching starts yelling at me for wiping. I called myself out as soon as I saw my hand had paint on it but this guy was so sure he caught me cheating. Is this illegal in tournament play? Where is the line in walk-on play"
Mini GS not firing. Just got it in the mail. Help?: 
"Found an expired 20oz tank: So I found an old expired 20oz tank about 5 years past its date, not sure if its empty. Should I expell the air myself with an empty gun or should I bring it to a shop to have it checked/disposed of?"

But I came into this sport 15 years ago as a 15 year old and I loved it so much my first ever job was as a gun tech at my local store. I don't miss the cheater boards, but I miss the reg, trigger, bolt, asa, grip, ect upgrades that made a marker feel like ""mine""."

There is no on/off ASA. The gun won’t fire unless there is a ball in the marker.So how on earth do I go about unscrewing my tank without blowing the o-rings?"

"Tippmann A5 trigger issues.: So when I fire my trigger doesn't return all the way. What I mean is after I fire once, I must push it back to the normal position in order for it to fire again. It's as if I wanna say a spring in my trigger isn't pushing it to its full release. I have to manually push it back sometimes and it causes problems when shooting. Now, it does return. But not completely to where I can press again and fire. I have to press, then let the trigger return like it normally does, then I have to do a slight push with my finger for it to fire correctly again. Any ideas what it could be or any help?"

"I need some serious help.: So, this isn’t the first or second time this happened, I purchased a Dye M2 mosair from ansgear last summer I went paint balling a few times with it. This gun likes to shoot the eye pipe out of the gun. I replaced the eye pipe once and thought it wasn’t a big deal whatever. Then it happened again and replaced it. Then I stopped paint balling due to school this year. School just ended I purchased another eye pipe and I went to go shoot around with it and the problem is still here. Shoots fine for 50 shots then the trigger feels different and the balls with 1. Either clump together and I will shoot 3-4 balls 10 feet in front of me or 2. I will shoot a single ball and it will just fall 10 feet. I think this happens after the eye pipe flew out of my gun. What should I do? I have the warranty for the gun, but I don’t know how long it lasts. And if i should send it back with no eye pipe in it."
"Velocity inconsistency: Hi, I've noticed that my RSX fluctuate alot in velocity. If I crono it to 280 it can be +/- 15. I haven't got a tank yet so I use my fields steeltanks. Can it be because of wrong psi on the tank or anything else?"

"Ah fuck here we go again, Canadian ballers are shafted again: So, MG100 is 449 in US, which translates to 590 CAD. (So much for $400 everyone was talking about.) Lets make it 599 CAD to cover the cross border shipping etc. Except not. Its 669 CAD in Canada which after tax comes out to 757.85 or $576 USD. Someone already mentioned on pbn that its 470€ plus 21% VAT in germany. After speaking with a local distributor, they insisted that Canadian MAP is $510 USD per request from PE and not because of their markup. I was really looking to buy this marker, this is really disappointing."

"Would the Ego 9 still be competitive?: It has been many years since I’ve been on the scene, but I’m dusting the cobwebs and wanted to know if my ‘ol Ego 9 would still be considered competitive in today’s current lineup of markers, or if I would be better off upgrading before I hit the fields?Haven’t fired her up in years so I’m unaware how she’ll perform after a good maintenance run through. If anyone has some good tips on “reviving guns” after such a long time sitting in the box, I’d appreciate it. I’m unaware if there’s any sort of long term lingering issues that could arise from such a drought.  Thank you!"

I told him I think that might fuck up the gun, but what do you guys think because I want to, but I also dont wanna fuck my gun. Tips and alternatives to a smoother trigger pull appreciated."
There is a serious lack of Phantoms haunting r/paintball . Imma fix that.: 
Trilogy Project question: I bought this trilogy pump as a project and converted it into a pump. The previous owner drilled these 2 holes right next the integrated 3 way. Do I need to buy a new body? Will the pump still shoot? I haven't aired it up yet as my tank just got back from hydro and the nearest shop to fill up is about an hour away.

"What are the advantages of speedball pants? (Do you need a pair?): So I'm currently using sport pants when playing (the nylon type, not sweatpants), and they work really well for me. I'm looking into buying a pair of pants but they are very expensive in Canada (150 to 200 $ Canadian) and I can't really see any point in buying one, other than they look better. &amp;#x200B;Are there some pants secrets I am not aware of? 200$ is a lot of money for esthetics.&amp;#x200B;PS I am not a speedball player, only a recball player."
Brand new Ninja SL2 Tank with standard V2 reg is hard to engage with POPS ASA on LV1 and CS1: I feel like it might be because the output pressure on the tank is too high but not sure.. Should I remove the shims to decrease the output pressure? The manual said it should still work with 800 psi though? I have been using the older Ninja tanks until now so i'm a bit of a newbie with these newer regs.
"Need help with pump set up: First time getting paint ball gear, I've already bought a purple virtue vio acend and a earth/purple Azodin KP3 I want my color scheme to be around the purple, black and white area and I'm looking for a tank around $200.

"Need help identifying marker: Hi everyone,Over the weekend, i was given an Angel marker as payment for some work i did for a family friend.I haven't played paintball for a long time (since the Tippman A5) and really know nothing about this marker.The marker in question: [https://ibb.co/CQX1NvJ](https://ibb.co/CQX1NvJ)&amp;#x200B;I guess my questions are:What model is this? (or any info on it)If i were to start playing again, could this gun compete with todays guns?The gun is very dirty and i dont have the charger for it. Does anyone know or recommend a place near SE Michigan that could get this gun in working order?&amp;#x200B;Thanks everyone"
"Bob long insight pressure issues.: Just bought a bob long insight. When i aired up the gun and shot it, first shots were like 225,220,198. Put my reflex engine from my phase in it. Shots were like 240,242, 228. Then when i put my stock engine back in, it shot around 210, 180, 167, then the marker would not shoot. It would vent from the solenoid hole when i would shoot, but it would only push the ball into the barrel. I thought it might be my tank so i switched to my other tank, same issues, i put my stock phase engine, reflex engine, and stock insight into it, all same issue, put all 3 engines in my phase and shot great, both tanks (450psi output)  also worked great on phase. I thought it might be hpr needing service so i swapped regs on phase which was freshly rebuilt, same issue, insight reg shot good on phase too. I then tried backing velocity all the way out. Gun started to cycle again, got velocity up to about 220 and started shooting lower until it was just venting from solenoid after each shot again. No leaks at all from marker. I checked all orings and lubed very well but like i was saying, everything from insight worked on phase just fine. Im thinking solenoid needs rebuild/cleaning maybe? Maybe internal hoses have kink or something?"

"Planet Eclipse Emek Issue: Probably not the title that anyone expected to see on this subreddit..My Emek will randomly start stuttering (just like a Tippmann 98 when you run out of air) randomly and when I have plenty of air left (well over 2k). It happened twice yesterday during about 3 hours of play with the marker. It is brand new but this issue happened with an Emek that I owned before this one as well (I sold it and regretted it so I bought another). I was running a Dye rotor and Ninja 48/3000 on it yesterday, and with the first Emek I was using the same Ninja tank and a PAL loader. With the PAL loader though, when this occurred, it would chop paint.The marker would do it without me even pulling the trigger, for about a half second on both occasions, and then stop just as quickly. I could continue using the marker as usual after this occurred on all of the occasions.I've looked around on Google but it doesn't seem like anyone else is having this issue. I haven't messed with my tanks output pressure at all and the Dye rotor is what it is, no settings to mess with. Could this be a tank issue? Or is it possible that it's the Emek? I have normal amounts of lube on the bolt as well, nothing over the top. Any help is greatly appreciated."
So hot: 
"Don't Argue on the Field: During a rec round today: I ended up in a situation where a rental player entered into a close quarters house I was in. I shot them in the tank to try and not hurt them. They heard my gun and shot back at me. Although annoying, perfectly reasonable as they didn't feel the hit on their body.Before walking off, I took the time to calmly explain that a hit anywhere on your equipment or body counts as an out, and the player wouldn't listen to me. I even showed a fair hit that was on his rental camo instead of their tank, but that also wasn't good enough for them. I decided it wasn't worth trying to argue with a renter over whether they were out or not, so I called myself out and started walking off. They called for a paint check. Refs couldn't hear him. Gets shot square in the ear by another player. Proceeds to go berserk, throws rental marker to the ground, and started kicking and punching the house walls he was in.If only the fella hadn't have argued being in, he wouldn't have gotten blasted again and would have been able to walk off in a funny close quarters situation that we both could have laughed about! Now they're in a situation where a majority of the staging area is laughing at them for handling themselves so poorly.IMO, the guy should be banned for treating the field so poorly. Shit hurts, don't take it out on the field."

Looking to get back in after being out for 15 years: Hello! So I used to ball back in the day. I played speedball exclusively. Stopped around 05 back when my rat impulse was still cool. I’m looking to get back in but I’d like to play pump and would like to try rec or speedball so I got some questions. What’s changed in the industry? What would be a good pump gun? I see a lot of good reviews regarding the empire sniper What’s a good field in Southern California? I grew up playing at SC village but I’ve read some mixed things about that joint now. I’m in fullerton now but I’m willing to drive. Are there pump groups or teams? I tried looking but didn’t find much. I remember back in the day everyone was into race guns trying to shoot 30bps and I’m not sure playing pump with those dudes would be any fun.
Thoughts on zodiac zr1 marker: Someone local to me is selling a zodiac zr1 for 200 Canadian. Are they decent markers? I was gonna offer 150 just for kicks. It looks like it's in good shape. I've never seen one before so kinda interesting. Watched a couple YouTube reviews and it looks like a good deal for less than 200$. Thoughts?

So i was hoping that i could get some good recommendations on a marker to get.. I am going to sell my luxe so ill have a solid budget call it like 800 bucks,I was looking at the Tiberius Arms guns [This One](https://www.ansgear.com/Tiberius_Arms_T15_Paintball_Gun_Black_p/tiberiusarms15black.htm)And i like that it shoots both 68 cal and First Strike Rounds Just looking for advice so that i can make a good decision making the switch. I know that i am downgrading blah blah but this is what i want to do, I don’t wanna play woodsball or on an urban field with a luxe i want a more real military feel and i think that magfed is the way to go..

"How much extra distance will an Apex 2 barrel provide for a Tippmann 98 Custom?: I've noticed that some gun owners have much better distance than my 98 Custom. They also have higher-end markers, so it makes sense. How much extra distance will an Apex 2 barrel provide for a Tippmann 98 Custom? Is it worth the purchase? I know the barrel can also provide curve to your shot, but all I really want is more distance."

"NXL production: I will start by saying that I really enjoy watching professional paintball. I think it can be really fun and exciting to watch and I'd like it to get bigger. The problem is that the camera angles they choose to show the majority of the time make it almost boring. It seems like the majority of the time they are just zoomed in and showing one or two players sitting in a bunker laying down paint. &amp;#x200B;I don't understand why they don't at least periodically switch to a zoomed out shot to where you can actually see the movement and position of the players...like every other sport. It seems like this should be the default camera angle, but instead they only show that angle between points, or very rarely during a point.&amp;#x200B;It just doesn't make any sense to me. It is so difficult to get context on what is happening during the point, you rarely get to the see the important movements of the players, and it is very difficult to tell when people get hit and leave the field. &amp;#x200B;Did they try this before and people didn't like it or something?"

I was just wondering if you could, and if you could do it would it affect anything?"
"Buying an Ion in 2019, bad idea?: All of a sudden I have this urge to get back into paintball after like 10+ years of being gone (well technically I never wanted to quit, it just became too expensive after I left for college). Used to have a nice custom [Ion](http://imgur.com/a/0gZdz) back in the day, thing shot ropes after a few key upgrades (mainly the QEV and L7 bolt and that amazing Critical RPM trigger) and I'm seeing Ions on ebay for roughly $100.Would this be a bad idea just to get back in the game for as cheap as possible? Or would I be better off off buying something newer? I have zero gear so I'm starting from scratch."

"Selling Used Gear: Does anybody have any tips for selling gear? I’ve got a Halo B hopper and a 2011 Proto PMR I’m trying to sell so I can get an etha 2 or an etek4, but I’m not sure about the best places to sell it...Halo b has a hairline fracture near the feedneck, but only the outer shell, and the PMR has aesthetic bruises, but runs perfectly and has an upgraded solenoid...any tips? Thanks"
"Paintball in the last 10 years: Perhaps a strange post. I used to be deep into paintball about 10 years ago. Back when the Ion was the new kid on the block. Back when Smart Parts existed at all! But then school and work and more school got in the way and now I'm working as a lawyer and have no time to play. I was browsing some websites online and noticed a lot seems to have changed. I was wondering what kinds of changes you have seen that have been the most substantial in the last 10 years. Who are the big companies? Has paintball grown or shrunk? Does anyone care about balls per second now?Some things I've noticed from reading online:* Marker price has gone way down, and quality has gone way up* Some markers don't even have a tube between the dropout and the regulator, is it usually internal now?* Fewer aftermarket parts (eg. nothing compared to what was available for the SP Ion)* Two calibers? What's with this 0.50 caliber?"

People letting me swap out my rental 98 custom for there brand new cs2 to try out and lending me a pump gun to use for the first time to see what I liked better and when I was out of paint someone even gave me 2 bags they didn't need. And that was my first day!What have been some of your experience's?"

My question is, would it be safe to sell someone an 8 year old tank that has never been used before? Is the the tank safe to fill?

My goals are to find something reliable and inexpensive. I don’t need anything high-end, just something that allows me to play with my own gear and that works fine.

"What are the different tank types?: I know there are Co2 and HPA tanks but are there more then that and what are the differences between all of them. I mainly want to know to see if my field can fill them. All I know is they hook the fill nipple on the tank to the compressor and fill it, or something like that so is that HPA or something else? Edit: does it matter what pressure the tank is for the marker?"
Response trigger or double trigger?: I was wondering which one is better for the Tippmann 98. Or if you can make both work. I mostly play woodsball if that’s any help.

So the things we want to find are..Overnight events with camping (tents, campfire, not an RV spot necessarily)Preferably something in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma or Arkansas. From Southern Missouri so an 8+ hour drive isn’t really in the cards. We could get into speedball or even airsoft but that would mean we all need to upgrade equipment. We all run scenario guns and not speedball setup really."

"Upgrade Axe or get new marker?: Yizzo!So I haven’t played paintball in a couple years and am just coming back to it, when i had left off i had been playing with my empire axe, which feels kind of clunky imo. I have been reading some good things about the axe in terms of performance, but i’m not sure if it’s worth it to put up with the clunky feeling, which brings me to my question.I’ve been considering buying a used marker ( from what i’ve read i’m stuck between a couple but have been gravitating towards a vanquish), but is it more worth it to just outright buy a new marker or stick with the axe and upgrade it ? Any advice/recommendations would be appreciated Side note i’ve been looking for a new mask, i have a rather long jaw (im not really sure what else to call it but me and my i4 never get along) so if anyone could recommend a mask that doesn’t leave a good chunk of my chin exposed that’d also be appreciated"

"Piranha SRT Not Firing: Hi All,My son was gifted a Piranha SRT electronic marker and we're having some trouble getting it to work.  It's in very good condition and very clean.  We made sure that it has a full tank of CO2 and we replaced the 9v battery.  There's no detectable leaking of CO2 either.The problem is that when you pull the trigger (with the bolt cocked), the electronics will click, but it won't actually fire.  When we pull the ""sear release"" switch (not sure what the real purpose of it is), it will rapidly fire CO2 - so it's not like there's a blockage somewhere.  The same thing happens whether or not the gun is loaded with paintballs.Any ideas?Thanks in advance!"

"Reg leak on HPA Tank, advice appreciated!: I have an  Empire 68cu 4500psi Carbon Air System just over a year old that's giving me some problems. I was playing at the weekend and noticed a small air leak that sounded like it was coming from the small hole in the back of my gauge. It didn't seem to be causing too much of an issue so I carried on playing, at one point it even stopped for a while. Whilst packing up my 1.8K burst disk went so that kinda told me that minor leak might have not been such a minor thing after all.&amp;#x200B;I've taken the reg apart and the only thing I've noticed is what looks like some dirt/dust on the inside of the bonnet close to the valve that would screw into the paintball gun. Everything else looks fine including the o-rings but could probably do with a re-grease (which the manual recommends before reassembling anyway). So maybe I got unlucky and some paint/dirt got into the valve at some point which messed up the reg.&amp;#x200B;My plan is to clean it all, re-grease with Dow 33 and replace the burst valve. I'm just a little worried that something is up with the gauge since that's where this all appears to have started and I'm debating on chucking in a new one of those whilst I'm ordering some spare burst disks. Any advice?"

"Paintball newb: I’m new at paintball, and looking to get into it. I’m leaning towards the tipmann tmc, because I’m military and like the mag fed aspect. I also have heard great things about tipmann, and it’s a mag fed that won’t break the bank. The only down side is I’ve heard it’s terribly inaccurate. I’ve heard the freak barrel is a good remedy to this, but those are pretty pricey. So my questions are is their a cheaper alternative to up the accuracy? And if not what size insert have you found works best for the tipmann tmc?"

"What are some good paintball stories you guys have? I’d love to hear other people’s experiences while playing: Two of my favorite stories are both  from my most recent time I went out to my fieldMe-meDoofus#1- younger kid who came out and had no clue how to playDoofus#2- older guy who came out and also didn’t know how to play So my local field is Southern Maryland Paintball, which is kinda small (typically about 100 people including staff on a decent weekend). On Memorial Day, the turnout was several hundred easy, with almost everyone having literally no experience whatsoever. On the last match (spools field for anyone who’s played @smp), and most of the rental players (having no experience) didn’t know that they had to go back to respawn after being hit. Doofus#1 ran up and was in the open to everyone near me and just got lit up! He ducked back behind the spool after getting hit a few times, but didn’t go back to respawn...*Pro Tip Incoming lol*- when you are behind a bunker, keep in mind that parts of your body may be exposed...poor kid left is ankle out and I had to do it to him...smacked him right in the ankle twice and let me tell you I’ve never seen someone go back to spawn EVER in my life! After a quick and easy faceoff versus a rental player, doofus#2 decides to try and rush the right of my bunker... I had 3 other rental guys with me and I play speedball...bad idea to rush... we just straight dumped on him and he kept rushing only to realize that he didn’t even have paintballs in his hopper lol. After he got dumped on I didn’t see him at all until we walked off the field, and he didn’t go back out to play another match 😂"

"[Need Advice] Looking to get started in Speedball: Hey everyone. I'm looking for some advice.I'm interested in making my way to play speedball, with the hopes of competing in a league one day. I'm 28, living in Massachusetts (seems like we have some solid fields and leagues here). But I'm completely dumbfounded on what, how, and where to start.A little about why I'm interested: I love sports, and I want to stay more active. I like the idea of paintball, but I'm not interested in woodsball at all. I'm very drawn to the sports-like atmosphere of speedball. And shooting people with paint? Sounds great to me. It seems like a great sport that I can really sink my teeth into.But, my main question is for the experts out there. Pretend you are me, you live in Boston, MA. You own no paintball gear, you probably don't even know all the rules, and you want to do speedball (hopefully in a league, even though you don't have friends who play). What do you do?"

"New to paintball and I’m already addicted. Any advice from the seasoned vets?: Hello everyone, please forgive my formatting. I am posting this on mobile. And I apologize if this topic has been beaten to death.This past weekend was my first time playing paintball. I loved everything about it. I think that this could be a sport that I dive into and enjoy.I am wanting to purchase some gear so that I don’t have to rent a marker, mask, etc. I know the marker (or gear)  doesn’t make the player. In doing some research on markers, I saw that the Tippmann models were very popular on review sites but reviews elsewhere were mixed. What gear do you use/love? I have started doing research on everything paintball. My problem is that there is a lot of confusing information. For example, some sites saying upgraded barrels are a must and others say they’re a waste of money. I know y’all will be able to shine some light on the topic for an idiot like me. The ref at my local field (unbelievably cool guy) said that you just have to get comfortable with whatever you use. And I know that is some sound advice. I guess I am looking for a base to start. I have the money to invest into the sport but I don’t want to waste money either (if certain things are not needed or spending extra to start will save me in the long run). Let me know what you guys think. So far, I know a quality mask is my top priority."

"Opinions on barrels/kits/inserts?: Every time I see a post around here regarding barrels, the consensus always seems to be that upgrades don't add any benefits. Is this just for barrels alone, or kits (barrels + inserts) as well? Everyone at the fields seems to use barrels with inserts and say nothing but good things about them.So over all for barrel kits (inserts, for bore matching,) are there actual benefits? If so, what inserts (aluminum, steel, specific brands, etc.) and barrels (carbon fiber, etc.) would you recommend?"

Thanks!&amp;#x200B;Edit: I'm getting a TFX 2 and I have a Ninja 68/4500 so I'm good with that, just the marker.&amp;#x200B;Edit 2: I'm looking more for range than anything, but also kind of air consumption, but not as much, just mainly range(range as in distance) and little maintenance."
Bought a nifty vintage marker on EBay today...: 
"Regulator advice.: Bought a bag of gun for ultra cheap. It's a DP fusion fx that some one took completely apart and didnt know how to put it back together. I got a manual online and watched some videos and getting some screws that ware missing I got it put back together. OLED is bright, gun has 38k shots fired. In really great shape. But the regulator is missing. Any advice on the reg or should I just get the stock one from DP?"

I already shot a hopper with each (side by side), both feel lightyears a head of my decade old marker... still can't choose lol. Not sure why, but I noticed slightly more of a drop in the 170r's shot than the xls, is that normal? Is the xls known to have a further drop off or am I crazy? Maybe the velocity was different on each gun, Idk anymore."

Are either of these guns worth anything for friends to borrow? Almost like a personal rental. The least amount of money to spend the better, but at the same time i want something that will last without much maintenance. Opinions?Side note: i used to play more seriously (2004) but now days its more of a family thing in the woods. Maybe 10 times a year if im real lucky... so its not like everyone else is playing with a luxe!"

"GOG Enmey Aftermarket Barrel: Just getting back into paintball for this summer, I see a lot of enmey users suggesting aftermarket long barrels to increase accuracy/range/velocity. Now I love this marker but I did notice a lot of velocity falloff. Now last year I accidentally ordered a barrel in the wrong size and had to return it, can anyone point me in the right direction here? All I know is that its ion threaded. Also I have no idea how the freak barrels work and whether or not I can slide a freak insert into the stock GOG barrel or what.Also I'm looking to get a clamping feedneck and an on/off ASA but those are simple, however if anyone could tell me which brands to avoid that would be great.tl;dr spoonfeed me"

"Buying PE markers in Canada?: I've been looking at buying a marker for a little bit and finally settled on the Emek. Went to ANS and was just about to order it when I checked the shipping policy and apparently they don't ship to Canada? Apparently PE allows some stores to have a monopoly in some countries which means I'm going to get gouged buying in Canada and can't have it shipped from the US. Are there any stores aside from Badlands that are official dealers of PE markers in Canada? And that DON'T charge a ridiculous amount for them? For context, 219.99 on ANS (~292 CAD) vs 335 on Badlands. Failing that, are there any that are about the same performance/price (around 200/220) I can get in Canada?"
Does anyone know where I can find a replacement solenoid for my Smart Parts Ion?: I just bought this from eBay and took it to a shop because it was blowing air through the barrel. The tech said it wasn't repairable and I need a new solenoid but I don't know where to find one.

Friend upgraded from an Azodin Blitz Evo and wanted me to post it: 
"Spire IR Review, critiques and comments appreciated: Hello /r/paintball!I've started a youtube channel because I felt like there was a relative dearth of product reviews/information. Since I've started playing again, I've obviously tried to research a lot of gear and was disappointed with what I've found. There seems to be a lot of videos put out by stores, but there's an obvious conflict there that makes me feel like I need to take those reviews with a grain of salt. I really like Paintball Ruined My Life, but he's only one guy and can't cover everything. I remember having a convo with someone on this subreddit about this information problem and decided to do something about it.Eventually I want to branch out into paintball videos other than product reviews, but I want to cut my teeth with these types of videos first (also because a lack of high quality product reviews are the reason I decided to start a channel at all).Anyway, I just put out my [first review](https://youtu.be/WLfWKjnNKJo) and would love some critiques and comments. It's a review of the Spire IR, and I'm hoping that I've hit that sweet spot of informative, honest and not too boring. This is my first video, and the first time I've done anything like this so please feel free to give me any advice.Thanks!"
"Is the Etha 2 reliable?: Looking to buy my first marker and have been browsing for awhile, recently found the Etha 2 and the EMC kit that goes with it and I am a big fan of the looks and specs.

"Trying to get back into it, not sure where to start.: It seems like a common post, but after some time I've felt a resurgence in my interest for paintball. It's been years and unfortunately when I plugged in my Spyder VS2, white smoke came from it after being on for about 30 seconds. Is another VS2 a good enough gun to get? I found one in the original box with everything for about 80 dollars, or is there something clearly better for a similar price range?"

"JT impulse vs Tippmann TMC: I'm looking to buy a paintball gun and i want to purchase a gun that is reasonably good priced to performance. The two guns I am currently looking at are the JT Impulse and Tippmann TMC. I see the JT impulse is down from then 1000$+ price point to 375$, Which is my price limit on a gun. I would like to customize the gun but not to the point where i have to replace stock parts such as the barrels or high priced parts, I love the AR look can I do that with a JT Impluse without replacing the barrel? The Tippmann TMC is at 200$ with a variety of accessories included and reviews suggest you may need to replace the barrel for something better too. I plan on using it for the next 2-5 years and play with amateurs and intermediate players. What are the downsides to the JT Impulse VS the Tippmann TMC? Are the price differences worth purchasing one over the other?"

"The time I almost got kicked out of my local paintball arena for giving players on both teams each others locations: Just thought I would share this here vause it's a really funny, but short story of an event that happened in a match during my friends birthday party 2-3 years back.I had been shot in my nuts by a paintball that didn't pop but with the pain I called myself out and went to stand on the side of the map while out. A player on my team and the enemy team both advanced at roughly the same time and endex up taking cover behind opposite sides of the same barrel. They kept peaking the opposite sides of the barrel and somehow didn't notice each other screaming to their teams from both sidea of the barrel. This went on for probably 2-3 mimutes and so I yelled ""You're both using the same barrel for cover."" The ref the gave me a warning cause it's part of his job amd I understand he had to, but I remember him laughing about it as well. The situation was like a cartoon chase seen in a hallway with lots of doors.TL:DR ; That time opposing players took cover on opposite sides of a barrel and a ref gave me a warning for giving away their positions."

But I got back into it with a local field and now I want to pick up a marker and gear.I have the option to buy a used Dangerous Power G3 that works, a carbon-fiber 68ci tank (Out of hydro, but there's a place around that will do it cheap-ish) and a Halo hopper for $180 OTD.I normally play woodsball and I don't dump a whole lot of paint. Should I get this or something like an A5 by itself (I'm not finding any lots that are any good, just used Power Pack bullshit selling for like right under MSRP), and have to shell out more for gear anyway?

"ISO suggestions on a gun for a beginner: I’m looking for ol’ reliable. A trusty gun that won’t give me problems, but isn’t anything super fancy. I wouldn’t mind paying upwards of 100-200 dollars as long as it’s a good gun."
"Won a raffle today, deciding what to keep: Hey guys, first time posting (so I’m sorry if I’m breaking any rules!)I won the raffle at Cousin’s Big Game today and trying to figure out whether it’s worth keeping the marker that was in there. Everything else I’ve already decided to keep/sell/give away to friends, but I really don’t know about the marker. It’s a Planet Eclipse Emek - it’s a mechanical gun. I usually play with either dual wield tipx pistols or just my axe pro. I can’t think of a scenario when I would need a mechanical marker over my axe, but this marker is just so freaking pretty. Can anyone think of any? Has anyone used both the Emek and Axe and has any thoughts on separate situations for each? Disclaimer: I’m not on any team, I don’t play in tournaments - usually just a for-fun player weekly in the summer and I check our big games too (obviously). Thanks!"
"Paintball in/near Seattle, Wa: I'm moving up to Seattle next month and I am wondering if there is any sweet fields to play at !?"

"Geo 1 leaking out of trigger: Hi.  My geo 1 had a low chrono 220fps and then started leaking from the trigger. So now I'm not sure what parts to order to fix this as I don't want to order multiple times.  I'm thinking of getting regulator spring, solenoid gasket and I am wondering about solenoid casing or not?What would you recommend from common problems for this. Thanks!"
"AIRLEAK THROUGH BOLT: So I have a Proto Rize Maxxed and there is air leaking from the bolt... I've tried changing the O-rings and putting lube on it, yet there is still air coming out. Please let me know what else I should try."
This community hates my videos but here my latest: 
"Should I buy a D3fy Vertex?: Rec ball player here wanting to know if any of y'all know much about the D3fy Vertex. I'm having trouble finding reviews, and want to know if it would be a good marker for someone who only plays 2-3 times a year, but would like to play more often. I want my own kit, but don't want to break the bank. The reason I'm looking at the Vertex instead of something like a Tippmann 98, or a Cronus, is because it comes with a 12"" stock barrel, and appears to be much more compact and light weight while still having an all metal body.If any of y'all would suggest a different marker below $150 I'm all ears. Thanks!"
Dye rize: Anyone reccomend the dye rize?

"A genuine thank you to this Sub.: Not to bore anyone with the details of my personal life but after some major vet bills to keep my cat alive, my car breaking down and now a possible eviction notice I've had to hang up the mask and try to get rid of my gear. I genuinely want to thank everyone in this sub for reviving the love I have for this sport and getting me back into the game a little over a year and a half ago.Started back after a 15 odd year hiatus with a Cronus..played maybe a day or two on the field before I fell in love with....that dang Etha2 ;)Bought it almost immediately after everyone on this sub told me I wouldnt be disappointed. I was not. It awakened the beast lol. Blew thru cases of paint with it but eventually found my love in Pump play, and never looked back after that. I made so many friends in this year + of being back and becoming a regular at my local field on Sundays (Ambush in SoCal wut upppp!)I am not asking for a hand out, I am thank you all from the bottom of my heart for giving me something I really enjoyed doing. I wish maybe one day to return, but I highly doubt it due to my situation. This is my most visited sub for this reason. We have such a great community!If you are local in SoCal and want to discuss picking up my gear bag for a price, PM me!"

Killen it with a Broken Hopper - Shocker RSX Gameplay: 
Returning player need gear help: So I used to play paintball a lot about 10-12 years ago and now in adulthood I don’t play as much. I live about 15 minutes away from a nice paintball place and everything is free except paintballs for military so I’m looking to go more often. I just got done playing there actually and had to rent due to not having my gear anymore. Everywhere I looked I didn’t recognize any of the guns people had and a quick search online showed most gear I knew isn’t around anymore. Can you guys give me some info and what is good and what to avoid these days? Thanks
Tiger in the grass: 
"New paintball gun?: So I’m kinda in the market to buy a new paintball gun ( I want to upgrade from my 2011 PMR), and I got an offer from a buddy of mine to buy his old PE Etha lt for $150 and I was wondering if that is a good deal or should I save up more money and then buy something like an etek5, etha 2, or something around $400. Can you guys give me your input on what I should do and of any guns no more than $450 that would be a better option?"
"WGP Prostock pump conversion?: So I've come upon as the title says, a wgp prostock. After bringing it to my local tech he said it would need a complete front end rebuild. I currently have nothing in the marker itself, would anybody recommend putting a pump kit on it? He said that the components for putting a new front block and all on it (including him tuning it) would be well over 100 bucks and I've seen some conversion kits as low as 50-60 bucks. Any and all thoughts would be appreciated, I'd love to hear your anecdotes!"

I'm not quite there yet, but some old friends started playing on a team again and I think it would be some pretty good motivation to get things back together for myself. I used to also do a good amount of buying and selling markers, but I have been out of it for years. One of the favorite markers I've owned was an Ego11, but I also had a Luxe 2.0 and a Geo 3.5, so I'm thinking I might go for something I already know like one of those. What else is out there that I can find in the $400 range?2nd, does anyone have experience playing after an injury? I have a partially torn IT band that acts up once in a while but I've played with it for 5+ years. It's just gotten worse since I've stopped playing.

Lastly, if I could outfit it to be more of a sniper rifle I’d like that. But I don’t know if it’s advisable with the guns build. Any suggestions help! Thank you!!"

"Looking for marker advice for casual player (DYE vs Planet Eclipse): I’ve been playing on and off since the early 00’s. In terms of skill, I’m definitely not a beginner but I’m also not dominating tournaments anytime soon - I’m solidly average. I play mostly woodsball (fields are pretty small) and occasional speedball. I’m upgrading from my ‘03 WGP Autococker (side question: are those worth anything if I wanted to sell it?). However I now have the funds and time to get back in and need some help! I’ve been researching markers and it seems like a toss up between the DYE DSR, DYE M2, and Planet Eclipse 170R. My price point is the $800-$900 range. I take excellent care of my equipment but I want something really hassle free and is just going to work without a million tweaks."

"Question about tank filling: Hello,My local field uses scuba cylinders, some of which are 3000 and others which are 4500. They're all connected to some sort of manifold. I got a new 68/4500 (HK tank with the new blue reg) about a week ago and filled it for the first time at the field. They did it pretty fast, like 60 seconds, and took it up almost to 4500 on the first fill. Nonetheless, the tank itself became warm, and the regulator was even warmer. I would even say it was hot, but not so hot that you couldn't touch it. Best guess it was around 60 C (I work with 80 C heat baths at work and it wasn't that hot).My question is should I be worried about the seals on my tank? I know at some point I will switch out the piston to its low-pressure brother, and it will have to be totally degassed, so when I fill again, should I ask them to take it up slower, like to 2-3 first and then 4.5 when it cools down? Appreciate you guys."

( I think I can convince at least 12 people to join. ) What should we do to maximize the fun? (For the other packages, it says we need 20+ to have a private field. How important is it to have our own fields?)Any help or advice is appreciated."
I learned an important lesson today after playing for the first time in years..: Upgrading to a force feed hopper is more important than a higher quality gun. That is all. Hope everyone else had a great day of play today!

"Ansgear colored o-ring quality: Just bought a GI stealth used 50k shots through it. It needed a good cleaning throughout so I figured I’d order new orings and change them all out. The orings I got from ANS (gtek rebuild x3 kit) are a batch of various colored ones, I’ve heard in the past to stay away from colored oring kits as the rings will break much faster. Any truth to this? Has anyone had experience with swapping in colored orings?"

"Pimp my Enmey: I go paintballing once per year, a local field puts on a d-day scenario that is fun with friends.  I was tired of getting completely outgunned using a rental so last year I bought an Enmey on a whim.  It did pretty well, and a definite improvement, but can it be better?  I want to do as many upgrades as possible before I play next month.Current setup:  * Stock Enmey (non-pro)* Tippmann 48/3000 tank - Not sure if it is the tank or the gun, but I feel like I was refilling after every 300 rounds.  Also I am left handed and the threads happen to line up just right so the nut on the side was pushing in to my wrist all day and getting pretty painful by the end.  Maybe a different tank? Or a remote?* Dye proto primo hopper.Recommendations?"

"Dye Rize problems: I just brought my Rize out to use today, first time since buying it used(guy said he only used it 4-5 times). It was working great at first but then very quickly it started to shot one fine, then 2 rolled slowly down the barrel. Then it constantly would not shoot anymore and all just rolled down. I cleaned and lubed the bolt and cleaned the eyes, no problems there and the Tippmann hpa tank was full. What can I do to fix this? This is my first gun so I’m not too familiar."

I can't see any benefit - 68 doesn't hurt anyway, they seem to catch the wind more and I've never seen so many bounces in my life. What do you guys think about 50 cal?

"Upgrade 98 Custom VS New Marker: Hi all years ago (maybe 2011?) I purchased my first marker which was a 98 custom ACT. I dont paintball alot, Maybe once or twice a year. But I always told myself after a certain number of games with the 98 id either upgrade it or buy something better altogether. The only upgrades ive put on it is a stock. Still using the same hoppper and barrel( i made the mistake of ordering an 18in that was just way too much for me) . At this point the gun needs a new latch detent (Part#: FA-18), as well as a new tank. These i will be buying regardless of a new marker purchase.What do you guys think i should do, I read a bit about grabbing a GOG enmey(decent price). If possible id like to keep the entire purchase under $300 so basically ~250 for a new gun+ hopper+ whatever else needed(if i go that route)Edit: I mostly always play woodsball(not very far maps though)"
"Planet Eclipse Etek 4 tech help: Hey everyone, I recently bought a used etek 4. When I got it I disassembled it and check everything, cleaned it, lubed it, etc. Everything looks good and seemed to be working fine. It powered on, the different modes all worked, and air shot through it fine. So I went to use it at the field for the first time, pulled it out of the case, and now it doesn't power on (with fresh batteries). I did some trouble shooting later on and I have discovered that the board will power on only if the eyes are UNplugged from the board.Any ideas why or what the issue may be? The ride to the field was bumpy, so I thought maybe something broke, but it was in the case and the board doesn't seem to have any physical damage on it. Any help would be appreciated!&amp;#x200B;Update:So I unplugged the eyes and turned on the board (this is the only way it would turn on) and then, while on, plugged the eyes back in. It stayed on (unlike what you'd expect with a short circuit). Everything, including the eyes, seems to be functioning correctly. I can turn it off and back on again with the eyes kept plugged in now (as it should be). I still have no idea what was/is wrong. If you happen to think of anything, feel free to let me know so I can figure out the root cause.Thanks again!"

"Help with Leak - 98 Custom: After finding r/Paintball and lurking for a couple weeks I decided to dust off my old gear and get back into the sport. Only problem is that the only marker I have left is leaking. Its a 98 Custom that is about 15 years old. A little beat up but it has a lot of sentimental value for me so I would like to fix it. Long story short, I found a leak where the bottom line connects to the power tube/valve assembly. Ordered a new (steel) power tube and a valve assembly but it is still leaking. The bottom line threads look fine and I cannot figure out why it is still hissing away. I read somewhere that you don't need thread tape since the bottom line should seal itself just fine as long as it's tight enough.Has anyone else had this same issue? Is there something I am missing? I would throw it out and buy something used/new but this one is special to me."

"Planet Eclipse Gtek160r vs 170r - Other options?: Hey guys. I'm looking at picking up a new marker. I honestly don't follow hardware very often. I WAS looking in the ~$500 range, but I'm tempted to up that to $800.So. That said, what would you pick in each price range?TL;DR: Didn't realize this would be so long. These three questions:**1)** If I were to decide on a Gtek, would you recommend waiting and spending the extra cash for the 170r?**2)** What would you pick in the $800 dollar range, and what in the $500 range?**3)** Is the $800 range worth the extra $300 dollars over the $500 range?I was looking at a Gtek 160r, or possibly waiting for the 170r to release, and ordering that. Do you think the version differences are worth the extra $100? I was also looking at the AXE SYX in this price range. I also see the Shocker XLS is in this range, how do these stack up?For the $500 range, I was looking at an AXE 2.0, or the AXE Pro., as well as the ETEK 5. Mini GS is in contention as well, but I'm not sold on that, as the size is kind of iffy to me.I currently have a Tippman A5, so any of these will feel like a huge upgrade, I'd imagine. I've had limited experience with any other markers, besides some rentals here and there. Speaking of, if anyone has experience with repairs on A5s, I'd appreciate a PM. Trying to troubleshoot a problem, and not sure of the keywords to use to even get started.I'm just super torn on this at the moment, and kind of out of my depth on it all. I can do a TON of research, but my limited hands on experience is going to screw me here.Aside: I have a pro shop a few hour drive away, I'm planning on heading that way in the near future, probably after the Gtek 170r drops, to try and get some hands on with these guns. I'm not 100% sure what they stock, but some experience is better than none.Anyway, I appreciate any help here. It's late and I should have been in bed hours ago, but I got sucked into the rabbit hole while looking at all of this!"

"Help with race gun frame.: So all these cockers recerficing has got me nostalgic. I've got an old ANS GX3 chaos cocker that I fitted with a racegun frame. Racegun disappeared a while ago. Sadly my charging cable was the first thing to go. Does anyone know a way to charge these batteries or a way to get a charger. I've been scavenging the net and I cant seem to locate info that's not over 5 years old with links that dont work. I'd love to get it running again, so any help would be appreciated."

I have a cs1 and an emek and I'm getting into scenario play. How could I cheaply rig these guns to have snap points for a 2 point shoulder strap?: Something like a circular object I could easily take off and on but would hold the gun to the strap.
