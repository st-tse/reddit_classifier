[SATIRE] Report: White House Aides Did Not Brief Trump About Banjo-Kazooie for Smash: 
"⚠️Friendly reminder⚠️: There will always be people that are better than you in Smash. They could be 15 years old. They could be female. They could spend less time practicing than you, or more time. They could be good-looking, swole, successful in their career. Life isn't fair and sometimes people are just better than you at something.Don't make Smash your identity. Don't make Smash your only source of dopamine. Shower. Go outside. Enjoy other hobbies besides Smash. You'll be happier for it. You'll enjoy the game more and improve more when each loss isn't personal. Trust me.I feel like a lot of the toxicity in the community comes from this redemption of self-worth. ""Well my life may suck this way, but at least I'm good at Smash!"" Stop. It's a game. There's a very small chance of you becoming nationally competitive. It's not worth the controller-throwing, the REEEEs, the insults, the beefs. Respect the game. Respect the players. But most importantly, respect yourself."

"If the 78 day development cycle theory holds any water, Nintendo should be releasing a trailer for Hero sometime today.: [The theory I'm referring to is this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/bzryeh/my_theory_is_even_more_possible_now/)It highlights a pattern in Nintendo's development cycle regarding Smash Ultimate where there is a period of 78 days (11 weeks + 1 day) between character releases (Joker was released 78 days after Piranha Plant). There is only one sample of this so it is not much of a pattern, but tonight/tomorrow will confirm or deconfirm this theory.One additional thing to note is that the 78 day development cycle will align perfectly with release dates for future characters and end exactly when Nintendo said the DLC Fighter Pass will end (February 2020). These dates are:**Banjo: September 20****Fighter #4: December 7** (also coincidentally the same day Ultimate was released in 2019, but likely irrelevant)**Fighter #5: February 23** (per Nintendo: ""Fighters Pass content is available as it is released. All sets will be released through the end of February 2020."")On April 16th at 9pm EST Nintendo released a [reveal trailer](https://youtu.be/W4PG9qx9x2s) for Joker a day before the official patch with his inclusion was available to download. Knowing this, it is probable that they will also release a character spotlight trailer prior to **Hero releasing on July 4th** should the theory hold any water.Expect this trailer sometime tonight or tomorrow. If we are lucky Hero will be playable sometime tomorrow."
"WarioWare's Legality: This has been touched upon numerous times, but I am here to set the record straight, cut through the crap and give some real answers as to where WarioWare stands on the competitive stage list in Super Smash Bros Ultimate.**1. Where should WarioWare be on the stage list?**This stage should be a legal singles counterpick. This is also been the case in other platform fighters, namely Project M, Super Smash Flash 2, Yoshi's Story in Melee, and RockWall in Rivals of Aether is a counterpick. It should only be legal in singles since the main stage is too small for doubles to make sense and a counterpick since it is too polarizing to be a starter.**2. What does/would WarioWare offer?**This stage would provide a unique platform layout, no other stage has the same one with four platforms, two resembling the right and left platform on Battlefield except right over the ledge, and two smaller platforms, right above the other two. It also has no moving platforms, no slants, and no randomness to prevent it from being legalized (hazards off of course).**3. Why should it be legal at all?**When talking with others about WarioWare, there are a few problems that people have mentioned with the stage. I asked around on twitter and here's what I've got from others:**1.** **It has a very high ceiling.**This is a very common misunderstanding, and for good reason too. [This](https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/1140672650123104262/1140672631663996929/VkDQxsVl.jpg:large) demographic, credits to @Ruben\_dal for the stage data information, shows that WarioWare's ceiling is 210 as opposed to most legal stages 192. Yet the difference is extremely minimal, and I'll show you why.  [This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nvByE87-3apkRC98jZEmzPIyG5Ozm1H7ZCJIX2mKQkg/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet shows that WarioWare's initial stage doesn't start at zero, but instead at 12. This means instead of 210 units, it's actually 198 units, main stage to the blast zone. This doesn't make much of a difference in the game as Mario's Up Smash kills 2 percent later than on Battlefield, or at least according to this[ video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuqDx6IZ4nI)**2. The platform layout allows for simple and easy juggles.**The platform layout has worked in past games, as the aforementioned PM and SSF2 WarioWare and RockWall in Rivals of Aether. The two top platforms are also the same height as the middle platform on Battlefield. The platform layout just works, I don't really know what else to say other than it's been tested and it has been proven to work.**3. It is too polarizing for certain characters, even for a counterpick.**We can do a comparison to other stages that have also been very polarizing. Think Marth on Final Destination in Melee, or Zero Suit Samus on triplat stages in Smash 4, or Greninja on Final Destination in Ultimate. All of these examples show that just as polarizing stages have existed in past games. Turns out certain characters or playstyles do well on certain stages, who would have guessed. WarioWare is also supposed to be a counterpick, as in it is supposed to give an advantage to your character and not to your opponent.**4. Our standards for stage legalization is higher, why deal with it?**This is totally right! Our standards are a lot higher for stages. We don't have to deal with clone stages like Dreamland or Midgar, or transforming stages like Delfino Plaza, and we even can turn the hazards off for Unova, Pokemon Stadium 1 and 2, Kalos, and Lylat Cruise. WarioWare is nowhere near as bad as these previous stages mentioned. On WarioWare, you don't have to fight against the stage at all since it throws nothing unfair at you.**5. Why bother with a stage that will just always be banned?**Ban rate has almost nothing to do with stage legalization. If this were the case, then Final Destination would be banned, it didn't see a single top 8 game during Genesis 6, yet it's a starter. When looking at a stage to be legalized, it should be from an objective point of view, not an ""I don't like the stage and it should be banned everywhere"".**6. The side blastzones are too close (This is the biggest one obviously).**The meat and potatoes of this whole stage is probably right here. My main point in all of this is that just as small stages have existed in other platform fighters or smash games. It is also good to remember that dying earlier also means killing earlier. For example, It is much easier and noticeable to say ""I died to this move because of WarioWare"" than ""I lived to this move because of Pokemon Stadium 2"". I for one prefer having faster games, but to each their own. Without further ado, the data. WarioWare is, mathematically speaking, around 25 percent smaller than Battlefield.  [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/a3aid1/warioware_is_this_games_yoshis_story_frame_data/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), spreadsheet included, shows that Yoshi's Story in Melee is also around 25 percent smaller than Battlefield.  [This post](https://imgur.com/a/XKg9V), with a different spreadsheet, also shows that WarioLand, or WarioWare in Project M, was also around 25 percent smaller than its version of Battlefield. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find anything on stage blastzone data for Super Smash Flash 2, since it is not as well known. I did some very primitive comparisons though between games. Mario's forward smash kills Mario at 58 at the ledge on Yoshi's Story, 61 on WarioWare, 66 on Battlefield, and 74 on Dreamland in SSF2. Mario's forward smash kills Mario at 56 at the ledge on WarioWare, 67 on Town and City, 72 on Battlefield, and 74 on Kalos in Ultimate. The percentages look similar, but either way, SSF2 contains smaller than average stages. If two different game engines (counting Project M and Melee as one game engine here), can both have smaller than average stages, why can't a third? No, Project M is not a fake game, there are still tournaments being held and Project Plus continues to advance it even further. Super Smash Flash 2, while not as well known, is a great game and I encourage everybody here to give it a go. Also, check out BowlerSSF2 and Sherwood for some SSF2 content.&amp;#x200B;TLDR: Just as small stages have existed in the past, and it would still be even. It also isn't as small as some make it out to be.&amp;#x200B;Conclusion: LEGALIZE WARIOWARE AS A LEGAL SINGLES COUNTERPICK"
Cool combo I did with Bayonetta that I'm proud of: 
"Bocchi abandoning her account/tag, probably leaving the community.: "
"Bocchi and Etika: A Solution-Focused Approach: Etika and Bocchi are two recent, biting examples of a very long-standing problem that the gaming space (smash more specifically in these instances) has had in regards to respect, manners, and etiquette within this community.  The thing is though, I look around and I see a lot of problem-focused individuals just as much as apathy or mouthpieces for the status quo.  Each time a story like this breaks it seems like there's a wave of thoughts and prayers alongside cries of ""That's just how it is.""  I'm not an expert here, I'm not gonna pretend like I can change the world here, but shouldn't we as a community consider coming together and collaborating on ways to make these issues better?  Shouldn't the suicide of a major content creator loved by his fans be an impetus to think about treatments for this problem?  I'm just a no-name player that goes 2-2 at his local; are there more influential people we can recruit to begin taking action and incentivizing better behavior?&amp;#x200B;Again, I don't wanna sit here and start spouting out all the ways that we can fix this provided tens of thousands of people get on board, I'm well aware of the social reach a Reddit post can make, even should this reach the front page.  This thread is here to start a dialogue that hopefully others can chime in on with ideas of ways we can make things better.  Maybe there's a group, a club of some kind where all members pledge to be kind and respectful on and off the sticks.  Maybe some TOs can provide positive incentives for competitors: comical as it is, bring a stick of deodorant, get a discount on your venue fee.  Little ideas like this that start small and start simply with the potential to make some good change given enough traction.  If people have ideas, any ideas at all, let's discuss them.  I, and many will probably agree, don't want to wait until the next smasher/content creator offs themselves because of the inescapable toxicity these communities foster.  Let's start working together on ways we can make this space better for everyone.&amp;#x200B;As an added note, if you want to come into this thread and say this kind of change is impossible, that toxicity is inevitable and there's nothing we can do to change or improve it, please just don't post that reply.  We all understand what the current situation is; we all know the problems toxicity causes and how difficult it is to make meaningful change.  To come in here, or on any post related to these topics and say ""That's the way things are"" only serves to normalize this current state of affairs and validates everyone who doesn't want to do anything about it.  Shouldn't we all collectively want the best for this and many other communities?  Shouldn't we strive to make this welcoming and inclusive for everyone?&amp;#x200B;This wall of anonymity that the internet presents us with has long invited bad actors to abuse it for the sake of no consequences for their actions.  They can say whatever vile, evil, horrendous words they want to whomever with little to no repercussions.  Bad actors like these are causing good people to take their own lives, and to leave the spaces they very well could have called home.  Should we really still wear that lack of accountability like a badge of honor?  Should we continue to turn our heads?&amp;#x200B;Like I said above, any and all ideas are welcome to be discussed here.  I think we should start putting some serious thought into how we can make this a better space for everyone.  My DMs are open, and I am beyond willing to help out in any way I can."
"WarioWare’s Illegality: **A lot of people have been rallying behind a post encouraging the legalization of WarioWare. While I respect the opinions of these people, I’m going to have to disagree.** I’m going to counter some of the points made by people who want this stage legalized. Hear me out on this one.**1. “There aren’t enough legal stages that benefit more offensive/aggressive characters.”**If we look at *CEO and EVO’s stage list,* there are nine stages. **Four of them generally benefit more defensive play, whether it’s due to stage size or platform layout.** Those being Kalos League, FD, PS2 (which is debatable), and Town &amp;amp; City. **There are four more stages that generally benefit offensive play, whether it’s due to stage size or platform layout once again.** Those are Smashville, Battlefield, and the two Yoshi stages. Then, there’s Lylat, which is a mixed bag. It’s a wide stage that can potentially encourage defensive play, but it also has slopes and platforms.So, **if we look at what’s currently legal in the largest tournaments this summer, it seems to me that our stage list is already pretty balanced.** Adding WarioWare isn’t exactly necessary. It’s not solving any problems.**2. “WarioWare would give benefits to aggressive characters that other stages don’t give.”****WarioWare’s small size would force people into playing defensive.** You make one mistake, and it’s all over for you if you’re at enough percent. This means that defensive characters would actually thrive off of this stage. Especially considering that the unorthodox platform layout means that standing by the edge and throwing out projectiles can actually be a much more viable strategy here. *Just think of how Snake already enjoys platform control on Battlefield, and then multiply that.***Also, some characters like Yoshi are actually fast enough in the air to potentially camp out slower characters.** This is because of how the two upper platforms are not only far away from the ground, but they’re far apart from each other. Although, they’re just close enough for people to viably platform camp.**I can honestly imagine heavies struggling on this stage more than on a stage like Yoshi’s Story or Smashville,** to be completely honest.**3. WarioWare was legal in Project M, why not in Ultimate?”**The funny thing about this, is that WarioWare’s small size was so jank that they had to resize it to make it equal to Yoshi’s Story’s size (in Melee).**4. “Yoshi’s Story was legal in Melee, despite being almost as small. Why can’t WarioWare be legal in Ultimate?”**In Melee, losing a stock doesn’t have as much value compared to Ultimate. This is mainly due to having one more stock than Ultimate. Melee is also a fast-paced game that has a lot of quick kills (f.e. go watch Westballz when he’s having a good performance), so **Yoshi’s Story compliments the spirit of Melee almost perfectly.** WarioWare doesn’t really do that for Ultimate, so its legality becomes much more problematic due to that.(Shoutouts to u/voll_ssb) Melee also has much stronger and more influential DI, which means that survivability on Yoshi’s Story in Melee is arguably better than WarioWare in Ultimate.**5. “We should at least experiment with its legality.”**(Shoutouts to u/try1x) This stage was actually legalized early on in Ultimate’s life. One of the first big Ultimate tournaments, Don’t Park On The Grass, had it legalized. However, people did not like the stage that much.It was also legal in Xanadu weeklies for a long time, and due to this, was legal in the largest pre-Genesis Ultimate tournament (Glitch 6). It was also a stage most competitors disliked, so it was banned."

Some of my Isabelle highlights. And a special treat for those who have a personal vendetta against Lucas dairs lol: 
"How would you significantly shake up the next Smash?: It feels like Ultimate is the culmination of a general philosophy up to this point going something like, ""always increase the number of fighters and keep existing characters' moves 90% the same as their previous appearances."" Unfortunately it's kind of hard to imagine this trend continuing indefinitely or even past Ultimate, so I've been trying to imagine a hypothetical re-booted or bizarro version for the next Smash game. The only two examples I can think of are villain-based, where Wario and Waluigi are the main mascots and antagonists are prioritized for inclusion, and one in which the familiar core roster is back but with moves designed from scratch. I'm not saying I'm super into these ideas, I just wonder if eventually something like this will happen."

Melee Ledge Camping History: (2015 - 2019) CEO - EVO - SMASH SUMMIT: 
"[Speculation] By going off the news section, we may be getting a new update sooner than we think: First off, this is obviously just speculation on my part, and none of what I'm saying is set in stone by any means. I just felt this was super interesting to look into and hopefully spark some discussion.Now I believe that, by using the amount of post between each Version, We may be getting a new update as early as this week. I also believe that they are planning on keeping a schedule of **5 to 6 News Post per Update.** Below I've listed the amount of post made between each new Update/Version:VERSION 1.1.0 to VERSION 1.2.0 = 4 News PostVERSION 1.2.0 to VERSION 1.2.1 =1 News PostVERSION 1.2.1 to VERSION 2.0.0 = **6 News Post**VERSION 2.0.0 to VERSION 2.0.1 = **5 News Post**VERSION 2.0.1 to VERSION 2.0.2 = **6 News Post**\*VERSION 2.0.2 to VERSION 3.0.0 = 10 News Post (4 Regular Post and 6 Post regarding the Joker Release + Mii Costumes)\*VERSION 3.0.0 to VERSION 3.0.1 = 3 News Post (2 more posts regarding the Mii Costumes  and 1 Regular Post)VERSION 3.0.1 to VERSION 3.1.0 = **6 News Post****\*I'm only disregarding Version 1.1.0 to Version 1.2.1 because this could have been the devs figuring out a decent post schedule themselves since the game had just come out. As for Version 2.0.2 to Version 3.0.1, There's a total of 5 regular posts between these updates, and the rest of the Joker + Mii Costume info is just its own thing.**Now, Only a few hours ago before me posting this, The 6th News Post ( an event) has gone up, which leads me to believe we may be getting an Update either this week or next week. I have no idea whether it will be a 3.2.0 update or a major 4.0.0 update, but using what I've gathered from the News Section, I have a strong feeling we'll be getting an Update of some sort.Once again, this is just me speculating and using what I have to stir up some discussion and build some hype for the possibility that a new update will be coming soon!"
"On the opposite end of WarioWare being legal as discussion...friends played a local tourney where we picked random for all current legal stages... mementos came up during my play ...this is singles: Mementos being legal was...weird...too big and strange.I ended up haivng to camp a bit...played cloud against a megaman and got far enough away from lemons and blade... probably my best showing so far...only 8 showed up but I made losers finals (early out to losers and grinded cloud on game 3s to the top and nearly came out to grand finals but blew it on bad recovery)Weird format, mementos works better as a doubles level for sure"
Two in a row. Any other falcon mains out there?: 
Nash (falcon) does STUFF vs falco (mad matt): 
Zero Suit Samus Whip &amp; Jank Compilation: 
Melee Visual Overhaul Texture Pack: 
"What are the best teams?: I really like teams and want to share my own opinion and see what you all think. Keep in my mind, almost every team has a counter or struggles against certain characters so this list is ordered on how well the team stands up against all teams, holistically speaking. There will be a few ties. My list: 1. Fox and Falco (Team Starfox). Fox and Fox (Team 20xx).Starfox-While they lack the kill power that Double fox has, this team makes up for it in combos, stage control and even long range saves all of which are provided by Falco. This team is not countered by any team although they can struggle against double fox, marth, Peach, and sheik. 20xx This one is fairly obvious. Fox is a crazy character. This team is one of the best at getting kills and surviving for a long time. Is also one of the most versatile teams as they can kill with up smash and up-air and edge-guard effectively with back air and shine. While technically the best team, this team is also very hard to play at a consistently solid performance level. 2. Fox and Jigglypuff (The Power Couple) Possibly the team with the most killpower. (Rest and Upsmash). Puff and Fox Complement each other very well as fox and control the ground and Puff the air. Puff also excels at saving fox and comboing off of fox’s moves into an edge guard or rest. Very few teams counter this team except maybe the teams listed above. 3. Sheik and Peach (Team Dummy Thwack). This team has an insane combo game and high survivability. While they struggle against double puff and perhaps double fox in some cases, they are a solid team and have few weaknesses. They lack in killpower and if separated can struggle. But their ability to rack up crazy amounts of damage remains their biggest asset and allows them to change the tides. Plus, their double downsmash always remains a formidable force, especially against spacies.4. Fox and Sheik (The Speedsters) Fox and Peach (The Cute Couple) Speedsters Fox and sheik are a formidable team and have the contention to be one of the best teams in the game. However, both of these characters get comboed fairly easily and can struggle to save one another. However, their speed and kill power remains relatively unmatched by any other team outside of fast fallers. The Cute Couple Basically the same reasons puff and fox are good, however Peach obviously has a ground game that puff lacks. This team can work well when either party is on the offensive, with fox’s aggression and Peach’s high pressure aerials. This team struggles most when Peach is knocked away and fox gets 2 v 1’d. This team has several counters especially on big stages if the Peach is ganged up on by faster characters. 5. Marth and Fox (Space Sword) This team has some very unique combos and pressure strings. Marth is one of the best support characters in teams and as usual, fox remains one of the best team mates to have, offering pressure and kill power to aid Marth’s ability to wall, create space and find grabs which can lead into combos. Marth can struggle against several characters such as puff, peach, falcon, and sheik in teams, however his ability to wall with fox’s support can render these threats ineffective. 6. Falcon and Falco (Team Big Dick Energy) Falcon is one of the few characters in which fox is NOT his best teammate. Falco’s ability to save with lasers from a distance when Falcon is off stage keeps this team viable. Their insane combo game and ability to kill early is hard for many teams to deal with. Falcon’s ability to wall out characters such as puff and Marth and Peach allow for Falco to survive and play more of a support role. However, either of these characters can go in or play support in any given time. Their ability to rack up damage and get quick kills is rivaled only by double spacies and peach and sheik. A very solid team. 7. Puff and Falco (Balloon Bird) Peach and Falco (Pink Bird) Balloon Bird The high aerial play involved allows both characters to excel at their combo game. Puff can go for rests and be saved at a distance by falco’s lasers. This team struggles of separated but can be very difficult to penetrate when they are walling successfully. Pink Bird Falco offers support with lasers and platform pressure while Peach stays grounded and centered and goes for edge guards. Falco is a better support role for this team as he is vulnerable at ledge but the roles can be switched as well. A strong team. I think from here the list gets very contentious. 8. Double Puff. (Team Bair) This team can be very hard to deal with and while they can struggle with all of the teams listed above apart maybe from Sheik and Peach, their ability to find kills, edge-guard, and stall can counter many teams comprised of floating characters or characters who are easy to edgeguard, such as falcon. 9. Falcon and Fox (Team Racers), Marth and Sheik (Team Beard, Double Sheik (Team Ninja) Double Peach (Team Downsmash), Marth and Peach (Team Royalty) Double Falco (Bird Gang)All oddball teams with varied kill setups. all of these teams are underexplored but have potential to be good, however they can get countered fairly easily by teams with higher killpower or teams that separate and egdeguard the pair. 10. Pikachu and Yoshi (Team aMSa/Axe) Puff and ICs (just big hitboxes)aMSa/axe Not a bad team, but gets hard countered by puff and spacies. Strangely have good chemistry together. Puff and ICsNot a great team but complement each other in some departments. With ICs patrolling the ground and puff the air, this team can rack up damage and establish control. Especially if puff is able to get a rest off of ICs grabs. Obvious hard counters are Falcon, Peach, Fox, and even Marth and Yoshi. Well that’s my list. Would love to see all of your lists!"

"I think I’m encountering “Smash Block” and I’m unsure what to do.: Just a little about myself, the first Smash I owned was Smash 4. I played pretty causally and didn’t really get into competitive until Ultimate. Since launch it’s been a constant struggle for me. Fortunately, my friend has been helping me along the way since he’s a very experienced player. However, what’s been a struggle for me since day one was something I couldn’t quite find the word to describe until now, and that’s “Smash Block”. Whenever I play a match with someone, whether it be friendlies or in a tournament, I feel like my mind just goes blank. I’m not sure if it’s bad nerves or what, but it’s awful. It’s like each time I’m given a blank canvas, but no ideas come to mind. I often just play reactively and seemingly on full autopilot. It’s not defensive, because that would imply I am anticipating and countering what I encounter, but I am not. This is the same feeling I’d get when I would start a race in track or cross country. As soon as the gun went off, my mind shut off and I just went. There’s no conviction or purpose in any of the moves I make. For example, I could be nowhere near my opponent and I’ll do a short hop aerial. I’ve spent countless hours watching guides, pros play, and practicing with my friend. But as soon as I get into a match, it’s all gone. There’s no plan, no ideas as to what to do. Just me choosing randomly from my assortment of known options. I feel like I’m losing my mind. It’s frustrating because outside of a match I know what I should try to do, but in a match it’s like I don’t and I’m conscious of this all. Has anyone else had this problem? Or am I just going insane?"

Nairo wins as Simon without using the 'b' button (for his Camelot bounty from a viewer)!! Quite an impressive accomplishment: 
"Let's Talk About Keemstar's Smash Tournament: For those of you not in the loop, Keemstar has been running events for various games (currently Fortnite and Minecraft) and has previously considered possibly running a smash tournament. In the wake of Etika's unfortunate passing, Keemstar received a lot of negative attention for the way in which he treated the entire Etika situation (read: https://twitter.com/Captianfalcon11/status/1143900270633672704). Keemstar has decided to create a smash tournament to supposedly honor Etika (https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1143634330318778369) and has since moved on to asking for suggestions of people he would like to invite. Notably, popular smash content creators such as Tempo Zero (he has since deleted his tweet about the tournament) reached out to Keemstar to offer support. Outside of his involvement with Etika, Keemstar is known to be a very polarizing figure in the community that has been engaged in way more than his fair share of conflict (watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVXebiZuxXY ). In fact, a popular Minecraft YouTuber has recently left Keemstar's Minecraft event. He claims this is because he cannot support what Keemstar as a person in good faith. On the other hand however, fans of Etika know that he loved Keemstar and loved Drama Alert. If Keemstar were to have hosted a smash tournament a few months ago, it’s very possible that Etika would have been hyped up and excited. With all of this in mind, do you all think it is appropriate for the community, especially heavy hitters such as ZeRo and Samsora, to support a tournament like this? Personally, my opinion can be summed up with this (posted before ZeRo decided to join Keemstar's tournament): https://twitter.com/zerowondering/status/1143571668796944384"

Quick question about wired vs wireless: is there difference between a wired game cube controller w/a adapter vs a wireless one?
"Just some spikes. Posted this on my IG page, but I wanted to share it here too.: "
"Potential Smash Bros Moveset for Monokuma (Danganronpa): There are many mascots from different game series, all covering a large range of game genres that have impacted the gaming scene in many different ways.  One of these genres is the Visual Novel series. Now, many would rather point to this spot being better for the Ace Attorney Phoenix Wright, including that he does have more Western support than this other murder mystery mascot, but Monokuma's and Danganronpa's influence and popularity in Japan is immense. And it has becoming for mainstream over here in the west, so I would say he holds a chance, despite being from an M Rated game. &amp;#x200B;**Statistics**Weight: 80Running Speed: 1.46Wall Cling: NoWall Jump: NoMultiple Jumps: He would have a maximum of two jumps before falling.Crawling: NoExtra Notes: Whenever Monokuma's feet touch the ground, he would make the little squeaking sound the Monokumas in UDG make when walking/running around. &amp;#x200B;**Neutral Attacks**Neutral Attack: Monokuma would do a slow simple slash of his claws. This is the basic attack Monokumas perform in UDG. Not much knockback, but decent damage.Dash Attack: Monokuma would dash forward like a Beast Monokuma, leaping onto all 4 paws with electricity covering his body, dealing electric damage while giving him extra distance.Side Tilt: Monokuma would do a quick swing of his gavel, not much damage but good at interrupting attacks.Up Tilt: Monokuma would perform one of his many sprites from the games, where he raises both of his paws up to the sky, making a rawr face while doing so.Down Tilt: This would replicate another one of his sprites from the games, this time him sitting down and his feet kicking to both sides being the hit boxes.Side Smash: Monokuma charges up an arm cannon blast similar to the one he uses in DR2's 3rd chapter when someone attempts to break the rules. This would be similar to Megaman's Side Smash.Up Smash: A Spear of Gungnir strikes up from the ground, making good distance. Monokuma summons it, and is completely vulnerable from his sides during this. The tip of the spear would deal the most damage and knockback, so spacing is key.Down Smash: Monokuma would charge a jump, slamming a gravel onto a Execution Button with the stars that fly out being the hitboxes. It would be right in front of where he is standing, and the stars traveling as far as they do on King Dedede's Up Special. Getting in the middle and by the gavel instead wouldn't do much knockback, but a slight amount of more damage.&amp;#x200B;**Aerials**Neutral Aerial: Swinging a gavel all the way around Monokuma, in a similar motion to how he jumps in a flip to hit the button in DR2 and DRV3.Forward Aerial: Monokuma performs a simple flying front kick, similar to his battle from Chapter 4 of DR1.Back Aerial: Monokuma slashes backwards with his claws. This is more of an original attack that just includes his claws more.Up Aerial: Monokuma punches upwards, replicating one of his sprites from while he sits in his chair during trials.Down Aerial: Monokuma smacks downwards with his butt in a sitting position, performing his sitting position from many of his sprites.&amp;#x200B;**Grabs, Throws, and More**Grab: Monokuma would grab with both paws, holding their front close to him.Pummel: Monokuma's tongue would extend out of his mouth, giving a single lick to the opponent as to pummel them, referencing when he licks the Monokubs in V3.Forward Throw: Monokuma throws the enemy pathetically forward, not having much strength to his throws due to stubby arms.Back Throw: Monokuma would perform a suplex similar to what Monomi performed on him in the 5th chapter of DR2, including a small explosion to launch the enemy.Up Throw: Monokuma slightly tosses the enemy up, a chain pulling them upwards by the neck. The attack wouldn't pull enemies off screen, just pulling them straight up for a second or two, no knockback afterwards. This is a common thing from the 1st executions of the games.Down Throw: He throws them onto the floor, stomping down on them in a similar manner of after he defeated Usami and broke her magic wand by stomping onto it.Forward Floor: Monokuma stretches out all of limbs out and getting up, in a similar manner to the Easter Egg scene. His front paws would do a slight more damage.Back Floor: The exact same as the Forward Floor, but his hind paws doing more damage instead.Trip Attack: Monokuma does a claw swipe around him, pushing himself back up afterward. Edge Attack: Monokuma claws his way back onto the stage, stabbing into the stage as leverage.&amp;#x200B;**Special Attacks**Neutral Special: A item square that is similar to the Item Menus from the games would appear above Monokuma, showing pixel arts of a knife, bottle, and metal ball. Monokuma would cycle through these items, choosing which to simply toss at the enemy. The Kitchen Knife would have the most range, but the weakest damage. Monokuma's Poison would have medium range in being thrown, dealing poison damage if the initial hit connects. The Shot Put Ball would have terrible throwing distance but great launching power. Each of these items can be picked up, pocketed, or reflected back at Monokuma.Side Special: Monokuma would throw a bomb from Bomber Monokuma, the distance being increased by how long the Monokuma charges. It would work similar to Snake's Brawl take on his Grenades for how long it stays out.Up Special: Monokuma dons a Destroy Monokuma's jetpack, getting slight vertical recovery and being more for horizontal recovery. This allows him to float in a manner similar to Peach's or Daisy's jump hover, but not for as long. Down Special: Monokuma would put on a siren onto his head, playing a song that affects a nearby radius that causes the enemy to taunt. This would be like how the Siren Monokuma reacts after being shot with a Dance Bullet. If you miss the hit like Jigglypuff's sing, you are wide open for a counter attack.&amp;#x200B;**Final Smash**Now if you look at it, there isn't much that Monokuma really does that is unique. Many of the animations and attacks can be recycled from other fighters or aren't too flashy, and that is the idea. Monokuma is a more basic in design mascot, and containing many references to series that are already in Smash Bros, so he would parody some of them with his own flair. This is where his final smash comes in. Monokuma would take 2-3 seconds of scanning in front of him in a sight range. If no one is there, the move fails. If he catches someone, he would use their Final Smash with his own Monokuma spin on them. Most of his development would go into this. There are a ton of things from the Danganronpa series to fill up some of the more problematic final smashes, like replacing Giga Bowser with Big Bang Monokuma and such. It would just be how he is, taking over someone else's thing and placing his own stuff there. This would also be a way to add in the executions, as Monokuma executes people from his series by turning their hope into despairs, usually by using their Ultimate Talents against them.&amp;#x200B;**Cosmetics**Costumes: Monokuma would likely not turn into these other variants of him, rather just gaining their colors on his base design.1. Base Monokuma2. Monotaru3. Monosuke4. Monokid5. Monodam6. Monophanie7. Shirokuma8. KurokumaOn-Screen: A podium is on the stage already, Monokuma jumping up from behind it as it disappears.Side Taunt: Monokuma would pull out a martini glass, getting angry and tossing it after seeing it is empty.Up Taunt: Monokuma would perform his Puhuhu Laughing Sprite, raising his hand to his mouth to laugh.Down Taunt: Monokuma would slide a claw against his throat, getting the message across of ""You're dead.""Victory Screen 1: Monokuma performs his Laughing Sprite where he lets out a bellowing laugh at the camera.Victory Screen 2: The hidden Monokuma Dance from the side game Ultra Despair Girls.Victory Screen 3: Monokuma turns around while sitting on a Swivel chair, playing with a string hand trap like he did in the 3rd chapter of DR1.Victory Song: The Chapter Results Jingle from DR1"

"I made a tier list of the character's classic modes in Ultimate based on my personl opinion.: https://m.imgur.com/xDqMJDSIf you want to type in the comments your favorite classic modes, please do so. Even though none of the tiers are ordered, my favorite classic mode is Megaman's ""Variable Weapons System: Online"", as it feels the most like an actual game. Another close one was Mario. I don't think there are any characters with necessarily ""bad"" classic modes though."

"Alpha release of the first Smash Ultimate Live Elo rankings: You can find it here: https://statsmash.io/[Blogpost](https://statsmash.io/posts/firstpost/)In case the poor DO droplet dies, here's an imgur of the top 20 (https://imgur.com/a/7BSnigf)It pulls its data from smash.gg and uses all tournament sets after SMASH CONFERENCE UNITED, where the tournament has at least 100 entrants. I wanted to add some more features like player elo history lookup, but with the fourth of July coming I'm going to be busy for a bit.Updated daily, though not much happens when tournaments don't happen.To preempt some things you may notice:**MkLeo**: MkLeo has an absurb elo score. With a margin of nearly 150 points against the next highest, Marss, he has like an 76% to win. That's what happens when you don't drop a set for 3 tournaments.**Tweek**: Tweek's elo score is a result of losing to Gonzales at SnS, who had a much lower Elo score, and not attending CEO while Ally and Marss had great runs, while Samsora still has a bucketload of points from his crazy losers 3-0 run at SnS.When he attends tournaments again, it'll begin to reflect his true potential better.Funnily enough, the last thing he did was win a tristate local, earning himself just over 1 elo point by defeating UtopianRay **Japan**: Japanese players are rated pretty low here. That's just because they don't attend that many large tournaments. Protobanham, for instance, has only been to 2 majors, Umebra and CEO. And in a single run, you really don't play that many matches. In his CEO run, he played 9 matches, and only 4 of them were in the top 100. One of his opponents was Vikki!Kameme and friends went on a VGBootCamp tour, but most of those were small tournaments that were not weighted heavily."

"I really wish this community would not be judged by the actions of Twitter users: I'm not going to say the community is perfect. I'm not going to say everything we do is great.But man...seeing the community consistently get shit on for what few people do on Twitter is just upsetting. Seeing people say ""the community is bad"" when it's just a few random on Twitter is garbage. This community already gets shit on just for existing and every negative point that's said once gets parroted to death. It's exhausting. It's tiring. I'm done feeling lower than others and being the target of hate just because I play smash. I'm done with the FGC harassing us for not being the same as them. I'm done with feeling outcasted at majors like EVO because I'm there for a game I like.It just feels bad, man. No community I've ever been a part of was ever treated this bad. Every single bad news event that happens in our community only ""justifies"" everyone's blind opinion they hold on us. There's no climbing out of this. This is just part of being a ""smasher"". And it really fucking sucks."
"Does anyone else get sore middle fingers when playing?: Nothing to do with flipping off the screen when you lose. But when playing with a GC controller, my right middle finger becomes tender after hours of playing. It's around the end of the finger and it needs to rest for a while.I know I have carpal tunnel syndrome, but I'm not sure if the two are related. Does anyone else have the same issue? Do you feel this problem when playing on a Pro Controller?"

"Advice, Please: How to deal with Ness as a Heavy-main?: I've been rocking DK since Brawl (Luigi, before that) because he's a giant, goofy gorilla just slapping people around and I love it. However, fighting against Ness is an awful feeling because unlike with most characters, getting hit with PK Fire as a Heavy is a death-sentence; it's much harder to DI out of it and it nearly guarantees a deadly back-throw. I've taken up K.Rool to try and crown-toss the oncoming Fires, which is a slight help but against an evasive Ness, it's very difficult to get in close without getting burnt. Not to mention getting pelted with PK Thunders if offstage/above-stage that, when dodged, threaten to turnaround into a PK Thunder 2. Does anyone have any tips to share?"

"Mewtwo's Weight: [https://imgur.com/a/2VWBR4n](https://imgur.com/a/2VWBR4n)Now to be clear, I don't think Mewtwo needs to be even mid-weight. Him being that heavy with such a good recovery would be a bit much. However, I do think that aside from making some of his tail not a hitbox outside back air and up air, a slight buff to his weight would really help him and is needed to make him more viable.Mewtwo has a pretty damn big hitbox even ignoring his tail, so I think making him Lightweight instead of Featherweight would be a nice buff since its size makes it easy for many characters to hit it with short hop bairs, among other things. It would also just make sense, seeing as Mewtwo is actually really heavy for its size and just floats around because it lifts itself with telekinesis. Somewhere around the weight of characters like Greninja and Sonic."

"New player and have a couple questions along with needing advice for Pikachu and Zelda.: I usually used the Pro Controller and ise hand held mode when I play at work. Do I want to change some button settings around to play better? Should I jump with a button or flicking the stick up? How should I be using the cstick also? Finally, as someone who just started I don't have a lot of the characters unlocked,but i'm really feeling pikachu and zelda and its hard to pick which one. What are their playstyles and are there any good beginner guides for both of them? I been watching the art of smash videos,so I kinda understand what I should be doing/avoiding,but whats the best way to start building my base fundamentals? Just the jumping neutral and running back and forth?"

Wii U.I picked up Ultimate today and I'm going through the Spirits Mode story, and I've noticed that quite often I'll be defeated even though my damage is low, like 40% or less.I'm guessing this is a new mechanic with Ultimate? How can I better defend against it?"

"Let's say I get hit last stock and the zoom cam activates. If I don't DI at all, will I always die?: I hear people complain about false finishes and I kinda have mixed feelings about them. If you die every time with bad DI, then I think I like the mechanic since it shows you that a player has a chance to DI correctly and survive. But if the camera occasionally zooms when even when you'd live with bad DI, then I think that's dumb because essentially the zoom informs you of nothing.So which is it? Also what are your thoughts on zoom cam?"
"How Did Your Favorite Players Perform (Relative to Seeding) At CEO 2019?: And we're back! A bit late, but back. Thank you to the folks at the PGStats Discord for the help, and  information on the seeding process for the tournament. This time we've done roughly the top 64 placements, as well as all of the top seeds. Please note that the team behind the seeding confirmed that many of the seeds were identical. This is coming right from the staff.**Note:** If you are one of the listed players and want to contribute a quote, please let me know.**Disclaimer 1:** Not all runs are created equal. Some players needed to take on monsters to get their placement. Some less so. This is not meant to be an objective quality match-up of players.**Disclaimer 2:** If a player had a bad tournament that doesn't make them a bad player. It is easier to perform below your standard then above. Thus, one tournament can make a career, but it can't break it. There are many reasons players lose.As fans we have a responsibility to be good to players. They cry and sweat for us. The goal isn't to make players stress out about individual placements more, but to catch interesting story lines and data. Don't be a dick to players.**Disclaimer 3:** It is easier for a low seed to overperform and for a high seed to underperform. Seeds are a stand-in for expectations. The shit part of high expectations is that beating them is hard. One should consider equal levels of over-performance to favor higher seed players in terms of level of impressiveness.**Disclaimer 4:** An issue with seeding is just as good an explanation for some of these cases as bad play is. It is not always possible to tell the difference.**How to Read This:** Number indicates placement relative to expected placement. The number reflects losers round expected to lose in, vs actual loss. At the request of numerous people from the previous two threads, we're experimenting with single number placement this time. What that means is that if a player was seeded between 13 and 16, that means they were expected to go out at 13th place. Thus, if they got a +1 it means they got 9th place. If they got a -1 then it means they got 17th.&amp;#x200B;# +5 or More (Star Turn)**Puppeh. 60th Seed. 5th Place. (+7)** \- Sometimes, someone out of the ordinary makes it to Top 8 with a lucky bracket. That did not happen to Puppeh. In an otherwise pretty reasonable tournament, upset wise, the PT main from MDVA went on a path of destruction, taking out Nairo, Abadango, ESAM, and Samsora in quick succession. He even gave MKLeo himself a bit of a hassle in winners semis. His insane kill combo on Samsora from 10% in Game 3 defined the run. A Star Turn in the truest sense of the term.**Dynax. 230th-256th Seed. 33rd Place. (+5)** \- Solid mix of luck and skill. He benefited from NAKAT DQing from his pool, and Number 2 Radda getting upset by the Little Mac Duffo. But, he managed to take wins over Duffo and then the much more threatening Saj. In the process he snuck his way all the way to 33rd.# +2 to +4 (Strong Tournament)**Zurak. 126th-192nd Seed. 33rd Place. (+4)** \- Had a really solid losers run where he beat Promaelia, Gum, Saj, and DRN. All of whom are strong Tier 2/Tier 3 talent.**WaDi. 16th Seed. 7th Place. (+3)** \- Just an overall solid performance. He lost the slightest of upsets to Japanese Mystery Kid Protobanham. But, in losers he beat Goblin, Mr E, and ended Sparg0’s path of destruction. His big dramatic win came from a last stock last hit spin attack on Samsora cementing his way to Top 8. He ended up losing a close set to Glutonny, but it was still a great weekend for MDVA.**Sparg0. 51st Seed. 17th Place. (+3)** \- Sparg0 had a very strong Saturday. The Mexican pre-teen managed to get a win over Myran and over Sinji. The former has seemed increasingly common as Myran’s results have declined, but the latter is very impressive. Between him, Proto, and Prodigy, this was a seriously strong tournament for genius kids hoping to be the next Leo. Also Cloud, apparently still a thing.**Neos. 126th-192nd Seed. 49th Place. (+3)** \- Not sure who this guy is, but he beat Eldin and Wizzrobe, so that’s some impressive resume padding. If you know him, shout out details in the comments.**Diabeo. 126th-192nd Seed. 49th Place. (+3)****Tremendo Dude. 126th-192nd Seed. 49th Place. (+3)** \- Got a pretty decent win over Za- I mean, Cookieslayer, in Losers.**Primid. 193rd-229th Seed. 65th Place. (+3)** \- Another strong MDVA result. This time it was in the form of a huge early upset over JW, the LeoSlayer himself.**Schrader the Toolbag. 193rd-229th Seed. 65th Place. (+3)** \- Possible contender for the best tag on this list sweepstakes.**Ally. 6th Seed. 3rd Place. (+2)** \- For once, Ally didn’t have an unusually easy bracket. He had to take on fellow snake MVD, Dabuz, and Marss to make it to his ill fated latest attempt at Leo. Good wins, hampered only slightly by a lost runback against Marss. Not much to say here. It was a really good performance from him if not a flashy one.**Dabuz. 7th Seed. 4th Place. (+2)** \- His largest tournament after the Olimar nerfs. Yet, Buzman did really well. His Olimar/Rosa/Palutena combination left him flexible enough to take on a wide range of opponents, and scored him key wins over Wishes, and a double elim on Glutonny. The man is nerfproof.**Glutonny. 10th Seed. 5th Place. (+2)** \- Glutonny is the undisputed best player in Europe and for good reason. He’s been farting on the competition for years. This time count MuteAce, Sonido, Prodigy, Cosmos, and WaDi among the heads he’s schlepping back to the artic (are there penguins in the arctic? I don’t know ecology.) with him.**Prodigy. 32nd Seed. 13th Place. (+2)** \- This was a great tournament for young guns. You might call them “Prodigies”. The titatular NorCal Mario Player showed up himself. He beat PGR contender Goblin, “The Best Player In Florida” Epic\_Gabriel, and even the newly ascendent Fatality. This wasn’t a breakout performance like his insane run at Crown. But, it was a solid final performance to put a period on his PGR season.**Vinny G. 48th Seed. 17th Place. (+2)** \- The artist formerly known as Rival. He didn’t win any upsets but he didn’t get upset either. A good formula for riding bracket chaos to a good placement.**Fatality. 46th Seed. 17th Place. (+2)** \- FATALITYYYY. The hypemaster comes out swinging for his biggest post-3.1.0 tournament. He beat Umeki, Myran, and 8BitMan here. How do you even win Falcon vs Olimar? Fatality has been on the war path for the past two months, and it’s been great to see. Near constant appearances on the + side. Here’s hoping the trend continues.**Sonido. 42nd Seed. 17th Place. (+2) -** Someone still has to be out here representing Sonic. Sonido’s +2 was one of the most impressive of anyone here. He started off with a big upset on Mr E in winners. Solid. In losers he got another pair of upsets over Mr R and Captain Zack. How do you get that many upsets and only go +2? Eventually his run was cut short by ESAM. You can’t outrun victory forever. Get it? Run. Because he plays-**Peabnut. 35th Seed. 17th Place. (+2)** \- Peabnut is clearly emerging as one of the South’s premiere players. Here, his notable win was Sinji. I don’t recall watching that match, but then it was PacMan vs MegaMan so I probably wouldn’t remember it even if I had seen it.**Epic\_Gabriel. 63rd Seed. 25th Place. (+2)** \- Another under 16 player kicking ass and taking names? What is this tournament? Smash Bros Junior? Good results though. A shame it might be overshadowed by his altercation with...oh hey, the other dude is right here. Look how that worked out.**King\_Chris. 65th-96th Seed. 33rd Place. (+2)****Uncivil Ninja. 65th-96th Seed. 33rd Place. (+2)** \- Got a pair of solid upsets over Anti and Cookieslayer. Shulk. Kinda busted. Uncivil Ninja. Kinda good.**Osiris197. 97th-125th Seed. 49th Place. (+2)** \- Ironically, considering his off the stage activities, Osiris actually had a good tournament results wise here.**RealSchon. 97th-125th Seed. 65th Place. (+2)****Josh. 126th-192nd Seed. 65th Place. (+2)** \- Great Incineroar. Bad Tag.**Player-1. 126th-192nd Seed. 65th Place. (+2)****Rango. 126th-192nd Seed. 65th Place. (+2)****HazMatt. 126th-192nd Seed. 65th Place. (+2)** \- Commentators rise up.**Stilios. 126th-192nd Seed. 65th Place. (+2)****Afmbot. 126th-192nd Seed. 65th Place. (+2)**# -1 to +1 (Normal Tournament)**Marss. 3rd Seed. 2nd Place. (+1)** \- Marss in Ultimate is almost the fulfillment of the promise of Marss in Smash 4. He’s so good and so consistent now. One of the moments of the tournament was Marss landing a down air spike on a Sparg0 who was already doomed. But, really the entire tournament was filled with great Marss moments. His close set with Nairo. His loss too and then runback with Ally. He even managed to get a game off Leo with a surprise Falcon switch. But, just one game. Marss is an amazing player, but like everyone else he is struggling to crack the egg that is Leo’s Joker.**Wishes. 15th Seed. 9th Place. (+1)** \- According to some folks on the PGStats discord, this was Wishes’ time to shine. He has his fresh new Joker. He had a lucky bracket, because Tweek DQ’d. Only...folks were saying he could beat Dabuz in winners. I thought they were crazy. I was right. Wishes is a great player and he did pretty well here. But, he still has a bit more work to do before he’s really going to be taking lots of sets from Top 10 players.**Mr E. 23rd Seed. 13th Place. (+1)** \- When Mr E is doing really well he...does just okay. A shame to say, but Mr E rarely finds himself deviating far from mean. His victory over MVD was really impressive, but he couldn’t turn it into a full loser’s run with WaDi taking names in the lower bracket. Still waiting to see his much rumored Chrom in Bracket.**Protobanham. 17th Seed. 13th Place. (+1)** \- The big question mark of the tournament. A mysterious Japanese Smasher who’d only attended like 2 prior tournaments and got Top 4 in both. People have been calling him the best Lucina in the world and he showed it here. His only upset was over WaDi, who was having something of a moment at this tournament too. But, the real shocker was his sets with Nairo and Leo where he took both of them to the very edge. Lots of folks complained about the Best of 3 format instead of Best of 5. This was the only time I really felt it here. How many incredibly badasses does Japan just have lying around?**Captain L. 39th Seed. 25th Place. (+1)** \- I feel like the more often Captain L makes +1 the lower his seeding gets. What gives? This guy is really good.**8BitMan. 33rd Seed. 25th Place. (+1)****Wrath. 54th Seed. 33rd Place. (+1)****Ven. 52nd Seed. 33rd Place. (+1)****Benny&amp;TheJets. 65th-96th Seed. 49th Place. (+1)****EKING. 65th-96th Seed. 49th Place. (+1)****DRN. 65th-96th Seed. 49th Place. (+1)****Nibble. 97th-125th Seed. 65th Place. (+1)****Kiwi. 97th-125th Seed. 65th Place. (+1)****Synergy. 97th-125th Seed. 65th Place. (+1)****Radda. 97th-125th Seed. 65th Place. (+1)****GenV. 97th-125th Seed. 65th Place. (+1)****Nelvin. 97th-125th Seed. 65th Place. (+1)****Stache. 126th-192nd Seed. 65th Place. (+1)****Stache. 126th-192nd Seed. 65th Place. (+1)****MKLeo. 1st Seed. 1st Place. (+0)** \- MKLeo’s Joker is starting to emerge as the final boss of Smash Ultimate. He hasn’t dropped a set with him since GOML, and his barely been forced to break a sweat. When you reach Loser’s Finals Leo’s Joker is waiting for you in the shadows on Winner’s side. That’s why Proto’s near win over Leo was so shocking and incredible. Puppeh’s too. How did they come closer to breaking Leo’s small but growing streak then any of the previously established pros? Will anyone beat Leo’s Joker any time soon? Time will tell.**ESAM. 12th Seed. 9th Place. (+0) -** ESAM had to have been rubbing his bald bald head as he watched Ally beat Marss. His record on Ally in Ultimate is overwhelming. His record against Marss is abysmal. But, losing to Puppeh (who didn’t?) made that necessary. Honestly, though finding ESAM in this part of the write up always feels wrong. His natural place is in the + column or the - column.**Cosmos. 9th Seed. 9th Place. (+0)** \- Cosmos did pretty good here. But, losing to Gluttony ensured that he didn’t get a place in the Top 8. This is good for all of us, as it prevented Cosmos from playing “AYAYA” as his intro. It is VERY bad for Cosmos, because he apparently promised to do another 10 hour “AYAYA” stream if he didn’t make Top 8. Rest in peace, you magnificent bastard.**Salem. 13th Seed. 13th Place. (+0) -** Is Salem just a Shulk main now? Nice try throwing Peach at ESAM. Too bad ESAM has been training on that matchup.**MuteAce. 21st Seed. 17th Place. (+0)** By no means a bad performance from the best dressed Smasher in Florida. He beat Utopian Ray and Abadango. Both possible PGR candidates. But, his hope for another win on ESAM were dashed. ESAM’s been practicing.**Goblin. 31st Seed. 25th Place. (+0)****Abadango. 28th Seed. 25th Place. (+0)** \- One of very many Puppeh victims. But, in his face he was expected to lose to Nairo anyway, so it didn’t change brackets much.**Raito. 27th Seed. 25th Place. (+0) -** Indirect Puppeh victim. Having to deal with Nairo that early in bracket was devestating to the entire bracket.**Mr R. 26th Seed. 25th Place. (+0)****Larry Lurr. 44th Seed. 33rd Place. (+0)** \- The only SoCal player to even make Top 48. God rest our soul.**D2da. 97th-125th Seed. 97th Place. (+0)****LingLing. 41st Seed. 33rd Place. (+0)****ZD. 40th Seed. 33rd Place. (+0)****Utopian Ray. 38th Seed. 33rd Place. (+0)****SaltOne. 36th Seed. 33rd Place. (+0)****Zenyou. 64th Seed. 49th Place. (+0)****Daybreak. 62nd Seed. 49th Place. (+0)****Kobe. 58th Seed. 49th Place. (+0)****Eon. 57th Seed. 49th Place. (+0)****Blacktwins. 53rd Seed. 49th Place. (+0)****Seibrick. 65th-96th Seed. 65th Place. (+0)****Plup. 65th-96th Seed. 65th Place. (+0)****Akashic. 65th-96th Seed. 65th Place. (+0)****Dath. 65th-96th Seed. 65th Place. (+0)****Snoop. 65th-96th Seed. 65th Place.

(+0)****Nairo. 5th Seed. 7th Place. (-1)** \- Nairo was the first victim of Puppeh’s reign of terror. We didn’t see the set in question, but we can only imagine it went about as bad as the other top players who ran into Puppeh. Nairo, however, decided that was not the end of the tournament. No, he went on a veritable Sherman’s March to the Top 8. Blank’s Chrom. RFang’s Pichu. Dark Wizzy’s Mario. Raito’s Duck Hunt. Light’s Fox. Wishes’ Joker and PT. Even, most notably, a dramatic win over Protobanham, one of the breakout stars of the tournament. All to end in a heart wrenching close loss to Marss. He was so fucking close to meeting seed. Heartbreaking.**Sinji. 19th Seed. 25th Place. (-1)** \- PacMan vs Cloud is an evil evil MU. Getting caught with Mexico’s latest wunderkind Sparg0 in bracket is terrible luck.**Ryuga. 30th Seed. 33rd Place. (-1)** \- Got Leo’d into oblivion, as expected, in the winner’s side. One of my great sadnesses about this tournament was that the single stream meant we didn’t get to see the re-run of Ryuga and Goblin’s epic set from Frostbite. This time, to Goblin’s victory.**Captain Zack. 25th Seed. 33rd Place. (-1) -** Zack was apparently still playing some Peach? A bit interesting since the other Bayos have been slowly coming back out of the woodwork.**Frozen. 45th Seed. 49th Place. (-1)****Rfang. 37th Seed. 49th Place. (-1)** \- Another victim of Nairo’s mad tear through the losers bracket. That man left some bodies behind him.**CharlieDaKing. 50th Seed. 65th Place. (-1)** \- As a SoCal person, this tournament was basically a disaster for me. Charlie’s loss here was just another example. Losing to Wishes? Sure. Wishes is really good. Fine. But, the DRN upset? That one hurt my California soul.**Blank. 55th Seed. 65th Place. (-1)** \- Having to play Nairo for 65th is kind of like being in hell. Yeah, Blank got upset, but she didn’t deserve that.**Morpheus. 49th Seed. 65th Place. (-1)** \- An early loss, sadly, for Florida’s premiere Megaman. In this case it was Saj and Frozen responsible for.**Thexan. 65th-96th Seed. 97th Place. (-1)****Squerk. 65th-96th Seed. 97th Place. (-1)****Kofi. 65th-96th Seed. 97th Place.

(-1)****La Luna. 97th-125th Seed. 129th Place. (-1)****Prospect. 97th-125th Seed. 129th Place. (-1)****Yoss. 97th-125th Seed. 129th Place. (-1)****Poet. 97th-125th Seed. 129th Place. (-1)****Phuzix. 97th-125th Seed. 129th Place. (-1)****RiotLettuce. 65th-96th Seed. 129th Place. (-1)** \- RIP RiotLettuce’s controller.**iTheta. 97th-125th Seed. 129th Place. (-1)****Ewok. 97th-125th Seed. 129th Place. (-1)****Mars. 97th-125th Seed. 129th Place. (-1) -** I feel like this guy could be easily confused with someone else. Not sure why.# -4 to -2 (Weak Tournament)**MVD. 11th Seed. 17th Place. (-2)** \- MVD didn’t actually underperform that badly here. His lost to Ally was expected. It’s not like Mr E is that bad a player either. He’s probably gonna make PGR. But, that upset hurt MVD’s results here bad.**ScAtt. 24th Seed. 33rd Place. (-2) -** Possibly a case of over seeding? I’m not totally sure about putting him over Captain L. But, he was coming off a really strong SnS, so what can ya do?**Dark Wizzy. 22nd Seed. 33rd Place. (-2)** \- The most technical of underperformances. He lost here to MVD and then Nairo. Losing to MVD and Nairo are not an underperformance. That’s bad bracket luck.**Umeki. 20th Seed. 33rd Place. (-2)** \- Overshadowed by fellow eatern invader ProtoBanHam. His -2 here was from an upset at the hands of Fatality, risen like a phoenix.**ANTi. 29th Seed. 49th Place. (-2)** \- Mario vs Shulk is a fucking rough matchup. Mario vs Shulk without MU knowledge is a nightmare. Godspeed ANTi.**Lui$. 34th Seed. 65th Place. (-2)****Cookieslayer. 61st Seed. 97th Place. (-2)****Magister. 59th Seed. 97th Place. (-2)** \- Magister gets most of his money from tournaments back from selling bitchin anime girl posters, so he probably actually cleaned up at CEO.**Wizzrobe. 56th Seed. 97th Place. (-2)** \- Okay, maybe Wizzy isn’t quite looking like the double threat that he seemed like at SnS. Though, one tournament does not a trend make. Still had an excellent Melee bracket though.**Mr\_Bones. 65th-96th Seed. 129th Place. (-2)****Jayy. 65th-96th Seed. 129th Place. (-2)****OverLade. 65th-96th Seed. 129th Place. (-2)****SuperGirlKels. 65th-96th Seed. 129th Place. (-2) -** Shoutout to Kels for having what sounds like a dismal CEO, experience wise. Hope your next tournament trip is better.**Promaelia. 65th-96th Seed. 129th Place. (-2)****Pellonian. 65th-96th Seed. 129th Place. (-2)****Ross. 65th-96th Seed. 129th Place. (-2)****Temptation. 97th-125th Seed. 193rd Place. (-2)****Samsora. 4th Seed. 9th Place. (-3)** \- Man, fucking ouch. Samsora went down twice in a row to arguably the same trick. In winner’s side he was about to win his set with Puppeh when Puppeh hit him with the silliest Max Rage Charizard Bair combo off the side and then caught him trying to get back. He fights his way to the edge of Top 8 losers only for WaDi to catch him last stock last hit on a ROB Spin-To-Win on the side. Again. Fucking ouch.**Light. 8th Seed. 17th Place. (-3)** \- Not remotely as bad as it looks. He suffered a tiny upset from Cosmos. But, it was really bad because he wound up face to face with Nairo in losers. Nairo proceeded to destroy him with his ZSS, a matchup Light has been known to struggle with. Rough, but nothing reflecting too bad on him.**Tachyon. 47th Seed. 97th Place. (-3)** \- One of Florida’s premiere talents. He ended up losing to HazMatt of all people. Guess we should call that commentators curse.**Rideae. 65th-96th Seed. 193rd Place. (-3)****Mr Riddle. 65th-96th Seed. 193rd Place. (-3)****TheReflexWonder. 65th-96th Seed. 193rd Place. (-3)** \- Suffered an early upset to Josh, an incredibly talented incineroar main who also happens to have arguably one of the worst tags I’ve ever heard. Seriously, you couldn’t at least put an “Epic” in front of it?**LordFrieza. 97th-125th Seed. 257th Place. (-3)****BobbyWasabi. 97th-125th Seed. 257th Place. (-3)****Myran. 14th Seed. 49th Place. (-4)** \- Another rough one for Myran. My only hope is that post-Olimar nerfs people aren’t too hard on him. Besides, Cloud-Olimar just seems like an atrocious matchup. Cloud’s dumb guy with a sword hitboxes are ideal for killing Pikmin. I wouldn’t wanna be stuck in that MU, that’s for sure.**JW. 43rd Seed. 129th Place. (-4)** \- This was a pretty heartbreaking way for JW to end the season. He came really close to PGR, but this time he just wasn’t playing at his best and suffered too early upsets. Not a lot more to it then that.# -5 and Below (Wash Out)N/a.# Final Analysis:Overall a really strong tournament. People expected it to be a huge upset fest because of Florida's deep well of talent, Tweek's DQ, and the Bo3 format. There was some upsets. Certainly Puppeh's upset steamroller and Nairo's corresponding loser's decimation made sure of that. But, this actually was a relatively close stable tournament with results in the standard range.If we're talking viewing experience, we can't avoid talking about the stream. Another tournament, another atrocious streaming viewing experience. I can't say that the folks running the stream specifically did bad. I don't understand the legal, technical, and economic problems involved. I can say that it was deeply frustrating every time the stream came down. I can also say that the single stream was just disappointing. Who still thinks that one stream on a 1000+ person tournament is remotely satisfying?The actual matches were a lot of fun though. Puppeh, Protobanham, Marss, WaDi, and Glutonny all helped make sure of that. This tournament was a good time.On a final note, this is the second before last major before the PGR. In the coming weeks, we can expect the results of all these tournaments to finally be put to paper. The PGR itself will dramatically effect seeding, because many seeders defer to Suar on how to seed events. So this tournament may have an outsized effect on future seeding. On that final note, I will put out a question to you.In future Tournament Posts, should I include PGR Ranks if applicable?Tracking Top 8 Placements and Majors: [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RlBaAfummqebG4gEVEE8nNbwlTV7unbzXbouCtSgbwo/edit?usp=sharing) (Needs to be updated)Past write ups: [Frostbite](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/aui3qz/how_did_your_favorite_player_perform_relative_to/?sort=confidence), [Ultimate Numbus](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/axehe4/how_did_your_favorite_players_perform_relative_to/), [Collision](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/b2icia/how_did_your_favorite_players_perform_relative_to/), [Prime Saga](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/bdbreq/how_did_your_favorite_players_perform_relative_to/?sort=new), [Pound](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/bg25yj/how_did_your_favorite_players_perform_relative_to/), [Get On My Level](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/bqpwqb/how_did_your_favorite_ultimate_players_perform/), [Momocon 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/btd3b2/how_did_your_favorite_players_perform_relative_to/?sort=new), [Smash N' Splash 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/bwa3pm/how_did_your_favorite_players_perform_relative_to/)My Twitter: [Here](https://twitter.com/statssmash)"

"Some Data highlighting the amount of Ledge Grabs done during some of the most infamous cases of ledge stalling in Melee, and what a proper Ledge-Grab Limit Ruleset would look like.: Before I begin, there are a couple of things to point out. ""LG"" is just a shorthand for ""Ledge Grab"". Second, I didn't mean to make these notes initially, but after they naturally happened with the M2K example, I decided to stay consistent. Things in bold are important values or people. Yes, I'll be drawing conclusions and recommending what I believe to be the logical conclusions to be drawn about what a reasonable LRG limit would be, but feel free to revise or refute these.Ah, and the LG values counted may be off by + or - 1, in all honesty.&amp;#x200B;[Saints Gaming Live 2017 Winners Semifinals - **Mew2King** vs Westballz - Game 5](https://youtu.be/jNsGp_ogUqM?t=15m14s)**101 Ledge Grabs**&amp;#x200B;Notes:\-M2K only LG'd a maximum of 4 consecutive times at any point until Westballz loses hissecond stock leaving M2K at a high percent lead with 3 stocks. This is where I believe the stalling formally begins. At 5:06 left.\-**Before this stall point, there were only 16 LGs**\-At 0:41 left, M2K stops stalling, since he is at 0% with 2 stocks and Westballz at 0% with 1 stock\-Using the start and stop of the stall, M2K Ledge Grabbed 85 times in 4:25 (265 Seconds). **If the rate of Ledge Grabs during this time were abused at this rate during the entire 8 minute match, there would be 154 LGs.**\-Admittedly, Westballz does not threaten the ledge to cause any change. However, the  risk is far greater for him to approach than M2K to be approached against due to invincibility and F-air mixups.\-This match resulted in the infamous comment by M2K accusing Westballz of “Stage Camping”&amp;#x200B;[Dreamhack Austin 2017 Grand Finals - Hungrybox vs Chudat - Game 5](https://youtu.be/728pggTHsDw?t=21m6s)**99 Ledge Grabs**&amp;#x200B;Notes:\-Stalling begins almost immediately. But just to humour the theoretical higher Ledgegrab average like with M2K vs Westballz, let’s say he truly starts stalling when he gains the stock advantage, at 4:50 (left), until the end of the match.\-This puts HBox at 70 LGs in 4:50. **If applied to the entire match, it would be 116 LGs.**&amp;#x200B;[Evo 2015 Winners Semifinals - Armada vs Hungrybox - Game 2](https://youtu.be/nEGsAWMkd6w?t=4m16s)**107 Ledge Grabs**&amp;#x200B;Notes:\-This one stands out as the worst example of LG stalling in my personal memory of the game. It was during the first year I was getting into Smash, both Sm4sh and Melee. Not to make this post too personal, but it's worth mentioning, because this also happens to be the highest amount of LGs here. And unbelievably higher with the concentrated  amount.\-There is a significant portion mid-match where Hbox changes to aggro before going back to the ledge, so in order to test this match’s worst case scenario, I’m going to take  6:36 (left on the timer) to 3:00, before Hbox loses his second stock and goes aggro (only to continue LGs at 1:38, where the crowd starts booing, unfortunately. Remember, this is a problem with Melee, not Hbox, not even necessarily Puff alone. Don't hate the player, hate the game, right?).**-With the time constraints above, the rate of LRs during that time used during the entire match would have been 184 LGs. This is ridiculous.**# Let's talk about a Ledge-Grab Limit RulesetI am absolutely pro-LGL. Let's get that bias out of the way. Regardless, I want to refute one of the most common arguments I see against LGLs. ""How are you going to enforce this? Is the TO going to have to watch every match?"". No. It's actually really lucky to have in the game, **but there's a value on the results screen (page 2) called ""Cliffhangers"". It's a direct count of how many times you grabbed the ledge. If a match obviously had some ledge stalling in it, either player can request not to go past the results screen and check the Cliffhangers value. If this value exceeds the LGL, the win would go to the opposite player. If both exceed the LGL (for some reason), then the winner would be the one with the lesser Ledge Grabs.** This kind of ruleset to the LGL would allow players to police themselves with the LGL. The TO would only need to get involved if there's an actual dispute.&amp;#x200B;The rules above would cover both timeouts and non-timeouts indiscriminately. It would be a total LGL ruleset, rather than one that only applied when a timeout was made, like in Brawl. However, if a TO wishes to first introduce a LGL rule for timeouts, that's reasonable as well. Now, let's talk values. All of these are my opinions, based on the Data above as well as my opinions on what is considered ""fair"" in a game.&amp;#x200B;First, you have to make the choice of setting your LGL at the actual values above, or the theoretical worst-case scenarios. See, if you go with **the average of the REAL LGs** above, **you would end up setting your LGL at 102**. Using the averages of the **worst-case scenarios** above, **you get a LGL of 151**. Obviously, this difference is too great. It really just comes down to what the TO values. Do they value preventing matches like the above happening at all? Then they'll set it closer to 100. Do they just want to prevent actual degen play from the worst offenders? They'll probably pick somewhere in the 120-150 range.# Personally, I'd set my personal LGL at 110.What would you set the LGL if you were a TO, or for that reason ARE a TO?I hope the data in this thread helps clear some things and give form to the LGL argument. So often do I see ""we need a LGL"" but nobody putting forward numbers, or how the rule actually works. And then it gets brushed away by the people against it and forgotten because of this. I hope this post actually helps a LGL happen!PS: If you want to recommend me matches to count LGs for to gather even more data, feel free. They should generally involve top 500 players so that it's relevant to high level Melee play, though."

"Just wondering if stiff buttons are usual for new GCCs and if there is a fast way to fix it?: I use a Pro Switch Controller for smash (originally using joycons then they fricking all broke from INTENSE SKILL).But recently I had been wondering how it be to use a GCC since most top players and even my brother uses them.So I bought one and automatically something felt off, the buttons were stiff and needed more force to get an input.I heard it could be that I need to break it in, but I don't want to spend many hours withering at my controller to get it to work like my Switch one already does."
"Setting up Project M on a PAL Wii in 2019: Sup,I've been reading through [these instructions](https://redd.it/12jfij) to try and setup Project m on my wii. All was going smoothly until I got to the USB loader GX part. I downloaded the 1.8 installer which should download and install the latest version of the USB loader onto my USB stick. However when I run the installer I get a message saying ""URL not valid"", presumably because the download link for the latest version is out of date, so my question is does anyone know which specific USB loader GX files I need to download, and where I can get them from.Failing that does anyone have a better idea of how to load and run project m in 2019??Thanks in advance.EDIT: Found a working easy to use USB loader GX download, [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbloadergx/) which contains all the necessary files to get the usb loader working. I'm now stuck at a black screen when trying to load the game, RIP."

"Argument for Joker being best character: Feels kinda pointless but Joker seems like he's clearly the best character in the game at this point. Key point #1 is that his moveset allows for combos as good as a character like pikachu, with things like his drag-down up-air being one of the more obvious things and his grab game complimenting his kit excellently, this is of course without Arsenne who simply makes Joker much more formidable at killing or threatening to fight. Key point #2 is his match-up spread: there isn't really a character that does spectacular against him other than maybe the pikas or PT at best (not certain) and/or Lucina (ProtoBanham v MKLeo) while doing extremely well against many of the other characters which are percieved as top/high tier for example: Peach (shown by MKLeo v Samsora) and feel free to state any match-ups which are good or bad for Joker to be of note. Side point: The argument MKLeo just being good is not a rash statement to make seeing as he's done amazingly with many other characters like Lucina, however it must be considered that Joker may be the one character that allows a player like Leo to dominate the scene currently just because of the skill required to make Joker actually be the best. The argument can be twisted to be that instead of MKLeo just being that good; MKLeo being that good enables Joker to be shown as the best character.Please, don't assume I am a skilled or top player; I am a low level player just thinking really hard about the game and many things were and still can be excluded due to half-baked knowledge so anyone who wants to refute, add to, or talk about anything that should/is mentioned above could do so."

"Am I actually carried? / Chrom advice: So some backstory: I was messing around in CPU battles the other day to try and find a new character to try, and chrom caught my eye. So naturally I took him to quickplay after trying him out offline. And I’ve been doing abysmally. I’m talking 6 digit GSP. I stopped playing just now and i ended around 500k. Thing is, i don’t consider myself to be a bad player overall. I have Olimar, Palutena, and Richter in Elite Smash. I follow the competitive scene so I have a good understanding of the fundamentals. But I have not been having a good run online with Chrom at all. I thought I’d be able to climb up to 1 mil GSP this morning but I barely made any progress. So does this mean I’m carried by 2 high tier characters and the WiFi Master Richter? Does this mean chrom probably isn’t the character for me? I haven’t looked up any chrom guides yet (just watched some sets from Shoyo James) so should I do that? And if anyone knows any good guides lmk. I don’t want to drop him quite yet. Idk just losing that much online and watching the GSP tank has been kinda demoralizing for me, I thought I was a pretty decent player and I’ve won against some of my friends offline with Chrom. Should I maybe try battle arenas?"
Why does lucinas up b go through the ledge?: Im not standing at the furthest point near the ledge but a good step or 2 away from it but she still hits me everytime she recovers
how come fatality is always destroying people in tourneys on youtube but I never see him in any of the big leagues: Like he never seems to be playing against ppl like mkleo or marss or tweek etc How come?!?

Ally with the godlike walkout for CEO: 
"I'm in an upcoming casual tournament and would like advice!: Hi all,As the title States I will be in a casual tournament for Super Smash Bros Ultimate.Now, I've played the game a bit but I'm not very good. I can hold my own with good players but only when using slow heavy attackers such as Ganondorf. I like Ridley but I feel like ganandorf is better. What do y'all recommend? I had a grand time playing Wolf too but unfortunately lost a lot with him."

NERF SNAKE (Tyler the Creator Parody): 
"Losing GSP when opponent disconnects?: Sometimes when an opponent disconnects, I just end up playing a CPU and end up getting no GSP. However, other times they will disconnect and it says that a communication error has occured, and it registers as a loss. This is not due to my internet connection, as I have a very stable connection along with an ethernet cord. I just played a game where at the very start the opponent was playing very bot-like (slow walking back and forth a bit, playing very predictably) and about a minute in, the communication error shows up and I lose a game's worth of GSP. This happens nearly every day. Is anybody else experiencing this?"
"Doesn't a hard ledgegrab limit potentially turn ledge grabs into something like an invisible resource or a second win/loss condition?: The way I see it, a ledge grab limit creates a metagame between pushing and exploiting it. A too high number gives weight towards pushing the limit to maximize your grab allowance, a too low number gives weight towards exploiting the fact that grabbing the ledge is a finite option. Many have been insisting that we just need to find the sweetspot number and it will magically kill ledge camping without changing anything else, but I still heavily suspect that that the sweetspot number just the intersection where both sides of this metagame reach equilibrium. Is the concept of strategically counting ledgegrabs really something that certain matchups wont get warped around? If it does, is that something people are okay with?I haven't really seen this particular concern come up at all in what little I have read when this subject is discussed."
"Very neat little video showcasing some things you can do in Stage Builder. Plus, the creativity and effort put in to make educational yet entertaining content made me want to share it with the masses.: "
"Is there any fanmade smash games that you can play on computers?: After Mario Royale and DMCA Royale were both copyrighted and taken down, I'm looking for a game I can play on a web browser or download (Preferably Super Smash Bros. Games), so they're easy to record using obs. Also, please include download link below, if you can find one."
Marss clutches out Game 3 somehow: 
"Where can I find events?: I have been looking for smaller events in my area, but have not been able to find any until after the event. I downloaded smash amino, but I don't know how to or even if it has that ability. Could someone please help me find out how to find events.Thanks in advance"
"Made a victory theme for one of my completely unrealistic pipe dream characters, Monokuma!: "

Glutonny gets an crazy 0 to death in seconds: 
"The State of 20XX: A Fox player hasn't won a major tournament since August of last year. It's crazy to think that it has been almost a year since a major Fox win. Even if you include individuals such as Armada who won a tournament while playing Fox as a secondary, it hasn't has happened in over 10 months. Even Captain Falcon and Pikachu have won a major before Fox. We all know he's capable, after all he's an extremely viable character that consistently ranks top 3 on tier lists. It's just that nobody has taken him to the top as of late. But Fox fans should remain hopeful because it's only a matter of time before someone like Leffen snags a big win. Will there be a resurgence of Fox this year? Will he climb back on top? Will he continuing losing? Find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z."
Made an Approximation of what people won in CEO's main games. If you notice any mistake let me know:

"I don't really like this tier list.: https://m.imgur.com/ZSpMzy3?rPotential-https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_E8EJm6QOMs1cbXDlhcz7Tza8MqyZU9gZVJIa25T2qo/htmlview#Matchups-https://www.eventhubs.com/tiers/ssbu/Results--https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AJs-mj5TTdkmkl7nhj4twJymVPTLTUdT0MBToL1cxDs/htmlview#In each of the 3 catagories, the point ranking systems work like this:1-12: 5 points13-24: 4 points25-36: 3 points37-48: 2 points49-60: 1 point61-72: 0 ppintsWhen it comes to tiers, top, high, upper mid, lower mid, low, and bottom tier are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple respectively.When it comes to the accuracy, I think it gets worse as you go lower on the tier list. The 0 tier is the exception.So yeah, this is, probably the worst tier list ever. I made it bad on purpose. Oof."

"A fight broke out at CEO and we should probably talk about it.: So I've been checking the subreddit here a lot recently to see if there was any story on the fight that broke out and I haven't seen a thing.

"Possible stupid question: Can I use my Switch to play vs against someone? Like for example in the way you could use 3DS as a controller, but playing on my Switch in handheld mode?: I've been going to local tourneys recently, and I have been taking my gamecube controller; I've since realized that since I always practice on my Switch in handheld mode, I should probably play that way on the tourney.  If that can be done, how would I go about setting that up?  Thanks in advance!"
"Worst Ditto in Smash History?: In your guys opinion, what is the one ditto that stands out as the worst in all smash games? It could be as simple as a General mario vs mario or go into specifics like brawl mario. What would be the one matchup that you would hate to play above all else, whether it’s too boring or campy or frustrating. Leave your thoughts down below :)"

streamer calls pulling 3 turnips in a row: 
"Since sponsors are a hot topic right now with Wizzy being sponsored, a comment for ALL Players and Commentators: I work with one of the major eSports teams marketing team. I have two simple comments to make to the Smash community:&amp;#x200B;If you are a **commentator**: PLEASE mention a player's team when you are introducing them or congratulating a winner of a set (no we don't expect you to say *Tempo Storm Axe* every single time you mention Axe during game commentary)If you are a **player**: PLEASE shout out your team in a post-game  / winner's interview&amp;#x200B;**THESE. THINGS. MATTER** to eSports companies. Smashers and Smash commentators do a VERY poor job of this, in GENERAL. Example: The words ""Panda Global"" or ""Tempo Storm"" were said a rough total of &lt;5 times throughout the entire Summit 8 cast. Liquid was said &lt;3 times. VGBootCamp was said **ZERO** times. Do you even know what the DS in DS\_Spud stands for? No, because it was mention **ZERO** times. EMG\_Moky, again, **ZERO** times throughout the ENTIRE Summit 8 cast. Ibdw who made the CRAZIEST run at Summit, did you know he was sponsored by a team named Ace? That is over **48+ hours of content.**Players are constantly under a microscope for performance and how well they push the sponsor's brand. It DOES help, even though you may not think it does.Thanks for reading! Appreciate it"

MKLeo enters the Arena: 
"All smash games (except brawl) have been dominated at least once by a player of latin-american descent: 64: isai (mexico)melee: mang0 (costa rica), hbox (argentina)smash 4: zero (chile)ultimate: mkleo (mexico)for brawl you could say nairo was one of the best and he has dominican republic origins too. latin america is op in smash"
"Setting up a smash tournement: I want to set up a actual tournament however I’m just confused if I’ll be able to contain within 3 hours. As I can book a site for 4 hours and I’ll need half an hour to set up and pack up. I’m thinking would a standard tourney with 3 stocks time limit of 3 minutes for 10-15 people be contained within 3 hours? Any input is great, I’m just trying to create a scene where I live."
"How do you like this story I came up with?: (I will be turning this into a comic)This won't be in full maximumiest detail, just from point A to point B, with some dialogue.

Maybe Dark Pit aswell...??? ) to make a team of 10 other extremely mega hyper ultra transcended powerful fighters, so there is a tournament every year, I can't think of a name, because I can't think of a name *EVERYONE* is there waiting to duke it out (cringe)Pit: ""Wow, I bet there is some powerful people there!""*At the tournament*Cpt Falcon: ""Easy wins, I don't get tired of prize money though.""Bowser: ""I didn't compete last year, and you only won, because Chrom lost his sword""Cpt Falcon: ""One year ago?

Why are y'all arguing who will win this year, it's obviously ME!""Bowser: ""Hahahaha! You always lose in the Quaterfinals, just leave.""Sonic: ""I only lost last time, because I was pushed off the stadium!""Bowser: ""First off ""I only lost because"" is terrible mentallity.

I've heard that name before... Oh, yeah. The guy that always get tickets for driving over the speed limit, and running red lights!""Cpt Falcon: ""Wait, those are what I kept getting in my mail??? I burned them with fire, because I thought it was a joke. Speed is my middle name, and no laws in the universe is going to stop me!""Sonic: ""Haha, speed is my middle name too, except I'm faster of course!""Cpt Falcon: ""Aight, bet.""Mario: ""Anyone know when it is starting?""Bowser: ""Oh, look who it is. Can't wait to crush you, that is not a figure of speech either.""Sonic: ""I always thought it was ya know, against the rules to kill in this tournament.""Daisy: ""Why is nobody talking about me?! Did everyone forget the me, the one who will win this?""Inkling B: ""Daisy, go back to your Tennis or Golf, the only thing you can win in, you do not belong here, that fact that you think you would get past qualifers round is hilarious.""Sonic: ""Good advice.""Daisy: ""You're all talking trash now, but just wait.""Sonic: ""Yeah, we will be waiting forever.""Cpt Falcon: ""Hahaha!""Peach: ""Uhh... Not Daisy.""Zelda: ""Nice Sword.""Marth: ""Thanks! 😄 Yay, I got my first compliment from a girl!""Shulk: ""Uhh... She complimented your sword, but okay.""

"I wanna give a shout out to someone who may have not got to Top 8, but he did in my heart: Protobanham. I've never seen him before and I LOVE Lucina so I was amazed to say the least. Taking one of the 2 sets off MkLeo is no easy feat. And almost beating Nairo, that would've been a totally different  timeline if he did. can't wait to see more of him. Also shout out to Puppeh, I don't even know how old or what region he's from but gj my dude."
"If you could make one balance change to a character in any Smash game, what would it be and how much would it change?: I’m probably going to fuel some salt here lmaoJust skip down until you see bold text for the actual part of the postGame design and balance is always a really interesting thing in any game, and really difficult to weigh. As easy as it is to shit on Nintendo and the patch team for Smash Ultimate, they always have a difficult task on them. Buffing and nerfing characters without making them unviable, broken, or making the game less fun to a notable extent is difficult. Just in patch 3.1, Olimar, Pichu, and Peach were all hit in ways that made them worse, but by no means unviable (except arguably Olimar’s shield poking thing which is just a bug and will definitely be fixed in the next patch).Everyone who plays this game always has a certain buff for their favorites and nerfs for their least favorites in mind. While the balance changes of this game are by no means up to us, it would be neat to see what people generally think would be good balance changes. The reason I added in the followup question in the title was because it’s important to think of how the change would affect the character at any level of play. For example, Olimar’s Smash attack nerfs in 3.1:At top level play, being unable to punish a smash attack on shield was frustrating, and the fact that it could be fired off in rapid succession was aggravating to many players. Regardless of how the Olimar player felt landing the up smash, it was almost certain that the player getting hit by the up smash would feel worse than however much Olimar player felt good (Basically, a giant negativity bias)In the meantime, lower level players using Olimar should learn that smash attacks are generally punished, and so their subconscious tells them to not use smash attacks as often, even with Olimar’s excellent smash attacks. Even then, not all Olimar players would have been abusing the smash attacks, and they are barely affected by the change. After the patch, Olimar is still a top tier character, and still can use his smash attacks to their fullest potential to win games. All of that was obviously one example that didn’t go too in-depth, but the point being, changes made generally have to weigh in several options. Characters like K. Rool and Isabelle getting nerfed because of low level players sucks, but it’s what happens, even though the game being balanced around top level players is generally important. **All that being said**The question at the top still applies, and hopefully encourages critical thinking and discussion, and not just black and white “this move should suck” or “this move should be better” arguments. As an example, I’d just like to see Isabelle’s Lloid rocket work. I’ve thought about fishing rod going through shield, but that would make it an incredibly aggravating move to fight and probably lead to it being spammed, although it would encourage players to just jump over it instead of shielding and potentially not getting as optimal punishes. Low level players would absolutely despise it too lmao. Making Isabelle’s Lloid work better would just make it more consistent, since it is an important setup and trapping tool. I’d also prefer if it had a constant hitbox while buried- ROB Gyro style- and didn’t hurt Isabelle upon exploding, but I’ll stick to one thing at a time and have it work before forcing the opponent to respect it. Anyways, thanks, and I hope your buffs and nerfs are pleasant. Have a nice day."
WaDi Side B's Samsora so hard it kills the stream: 
"Won my first Ultimate Tournament!: I just won my city's monthly local and I'm super excited. I never dreamt I could two months back and here I am now. Maybe you guys will experience the same if you're just dipping your toes into competitive. And honestly, I hope you do. It's a wonderful feeling having something you love and being good at it, and even making money. It's so cool. If my primitive brained ass can do it, you can too. :)"

"If Kirby's Move Set Was Less Generic: Something that bothers me with how Kirby is portrayed in Smash it that many of Kirby's normals are generic and don't represent him very well. This got me thinking, and it could also open up new opportunities to buff Kirby for the next installment since as is, he's pretty bad, and I don't think any amount of buffs will get him past low tier unless they get ridiculous and let him kill mid-weights at 90 with F-Smash from centre stage, and things like that. I'm kind of surprised most of his moves are still so generic, seeing as he's one of Sakurai's own characters.With all that said, I have some ideas.**D-Tilt**Slide Kick:  [https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Slide](https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Slide)Not a copy ability, but Kirby's slide is one of his basic moves and I'm shocked it hasn't been added yet. It could function as a combo starter similar to others like Cloud or Joker's, while also shortening Kirby's hitbox a bit less than his crouch to allow him to possibly low-profile under some attacks.**N-Air**Spark: [https://youtu.be/iioAuwWgTFk?t=29](https://youtu.be/iioAuwWgTFk?t=29)This could function similar to Pikachu's nair, maybe with a bit more range at the cost of being a tad slower though. It would allow Kirby to keep his drag-down combos while changing his D-Air, and the electric property would make it similarly great as a combo starter.**D-Air**Ninja: [https://youtu.be/nGKIUJp1n-4?t=120](https://youtu.be/nGKIUJp1n-4?t=120)Specifically, this would be the Ninja Kick, seen in the link. If his N-Air were to be changed to Spark his current D-Air wouldn't be needed for drag-down combos and free up his D-Air for the Ninja Kick. This would function similarly to the Belmont's, being a somewhat weak spike near the start and later on popping enemies up for a follow-up from Kirby. It would be at a more diagonal angle, and maybe not have as long of an FAF in order to allow Kirby to recover if he misses it off-stage, but you get the idea.**Up Smash**Needle: [https://youtu.be/u0vG68U0oJc?t=19](https://youtu.be/u0vG68U0oJc?t=19)Pretty self explanatory, it would be much more unique than generic flip kick #58 (counting aerials) and have a satisfying stabbing sound. It could also have better range than his current up smash and be a good disjoint with strong launching power, allowing his smash attacks to have different uses rather than all being fast and short range.**Side Smash**Hammer: [https://youtu.be/GXet1wrYe6E?t=30](https://youtu.be/GXet1wrYe6E?t=30)Hammer Flip, or his current Side B. Of course it's too slow and powerful since his up smash, if it were needle, would already cover that niche so it would have to be faster and a bit weaker. It could also have an upward swing like it does in the actual games instead of a sideways one to cover more space in front of Kirby and catch aerial approaches. Speaking of Side B...**Side Special**Beam: [https://youtu.be/SzfgG8qj5ik?t=381](https://youtu.be/SzfgG8qj5ik?t=381)This could have 2 separate uses, being a versatile side special useful for zoning and dealing with characters with long ranged normals.The first seen in the video was was the Wave Beam, which can be used if the move is held for about a second. It isn't anything complex, being a fairly large projectile a bit larger than Kirby himself with moderate range, quick travel speed and being fairly powerful. Like in the home games it will travel through all enemies hit, dealing a good amount of damage (9-12%), having good launching power and launching at about a 45 degree angle. It will also have quite a bit of end lag though, to compensate for its power.The second in the video was the Beam Whip, if Kirby uses the move and taps it or releases B before the Wave Beam is charged, he'll use this instead. It will be a moderately fast disjoint attack nearly identical to as seen, but maybe be at a slightly lower angle so as to be able to hit opponents on the ground when using it out of a jump. It will have okay launching power at a slightly higher angle than Wave Beam and deal decent damage, around 7-9%. It will be fairly fast for its range, but only hit a single time meaning if used improperly it will be quite punishable on block. This is to compensate for its speed, as it's intended to be a good spacing tool usable in the air.&amp;#x200B;I'm not exactly a Kirby fan, but I've played a lot of Kirby games and feel like Kirby is criminally underrepresented in Smash, both in his moveset and because of how bad he usually is. There are more possible moves that could be changed, like up air and up tilt, but this post is more to show that there's a lot of potential for Kirby's moves to be based off actual attacks from his games.I feel like there's a lot of potential for Kirby to be a very interesting fighter with all sorts of different tricks up his non-existent sleeve, but as is he's pretty generic and bad. I'm wondering if there are any Kirby players who feel the same, and what non-Kirby players think of a potential move set with moves like these coming from his established copy abilities."

"0 IQ Production at CEO: First they mute Hbox's beautiful singing, now it's looking like a Powerpoint presentation"
"Looking for advice on organizing locals.: Hey guys, I've run a few casual tournaments with Ultimate with friends. It seems that the people who have come (20+) are fairly interested in making it something regular, so we're trying to do a few more for the year, and when the new year comes around making it a monthly thing, and being more official and open about advertising it and inviting people. What is some general advice you would give someone seeking to host a monthly smash league?  While we do want to grow a competitive scene for people to get better and have good match-ups, we want for focus to be more relationship based and about building a gaming community where people can have fun and get connected.  The format we've used so far is we seat based on previous tourney outcomes, and new players do a round-robin to to be ranked at the bottom of the bracket. Use a double elimination winners/losers bracket, best of 3 sets. We have a venue we can use for free, and have only had to use about have the room with 20ish people and 6 set-ups. $5 buy-in, which includes pizza.  Also we are trying to figure out a system on how to rank people over the year, whether it be points, averages, or win percentages, and whether or not to penalize players who miss tournaments during the season etc. If you have a ranking system that tracks people over seasons I would love to hear it!  Me and my friend who helps me run it are planning on going to other locals in New England to check them out and see how they are run too.  Any advice, whether it be from your own experience from being involved in and running tournaments, or just from going to tournaments would be appreciated guys! Thanks!"

GameCube Controller for competitive.: I’m looking to get into competitive ultimate and I see a PowerA GameCube controller for $25 and a official Nintendo one for $90 and I’m very confused what I should buy. (Note: I’m worried the PowerA one isn’t as good as the Nintendo one but it’s so pricy)
Intense ending to Nairo vs Protobanham!: 
"Character Analysis: Young Link: I'm an intermediate Young Link main who is trying to, like all of us, up my game.  Since Young Link lacks representation among pro players, he's a bit understudied, despite most players viewing him as a high tier with plenty of ""p o t e n t i a l"".Because of this, I thought I'd share my analysis of the character so far (from going to locals, elite smash, and watching tournament footage that exists) to see:\- Where the community agrees with my conclusions, and...\- Where others disagree and could add to my understanding of the character's strengths, weaknesses, and matchups**Overview:** Young Link (""Yink"") is a character with excellent zoning tools and surprisingly good close quarters combo tools. These two strengths combine to form a character with tons of options for racking up damage and, when perfected, plenty of kill confirms.(Yes, Young Link's projectiles can be aggravating, particularly online.   Making this comment now so you don't have to :p )**Matchups:** I made a [matchup chart](https://i.imgur.com/BgflnB9.jpg), because a smash character is the sum of their matchups, right?It's incomplete, changing, and would benefit from pro-level competition (which I am not...yet), but it's a good starting point for discussion.In my understanding, Young Link does best against:\- Other zoners, by out-zoning them (such as the Belmonts, Samus, possibly Snake)\- Big characters, by walling them out and comboing them (Ganon, Dedede, Ridley)\- Characters that can get both zoned out and out-ranged up close (Falcon, Meta Knight, Luigi, possibly Ness)\- Weak characters, by having more options (Isabelle, Jigglypuff, Little Mac)Young Link struggles the most against:\- Fast/small rushdown characters that overwhelm him (such as the Rats, Fox, Yoshi, Squirtle)\- Characters with reflectors &amp; equally strong zoning tools to neutralize him (Spacies, Palutena, ROB)\- Characters that edgeguard him well (Inkling, Joker, Mario, Ivysaur)**Controversial Opinions:**1. Probably my most controversial conclusion is that Yink is at most only at a slight disadvantage against most sword characters.  Swordies are generally tall (easy to hit with projectiles), and generally have a poor grab game which, combined with Young Link's excellent out-of-shield options (UpB -&gt; Uair for 32%, Usmash and Nair to kill), make it difficult for swordies to pressure Young Link's shield unless they space aerials well.  Yink can both edgeguard and ledgetrap these characters effectively. The speed of Roy/Chrom, and Shulk's arts and huge sword, do pose problems for Young Link, as well as the ubiquitous swordie offstage counters.  But Young Link has the speed, range and mixups to, if not completely match, at least make swordies' lives difficult.2. I also think Young Link beats Snake and Ness, which I know surprises some people.  This is because Young Link can hurt them from beyond grenade and PK fire range, as well as compete up close with his cute little sword and feet (Nair).3. The main weakness I hear about Young Link (often from players who see little pro representation and are looking for a reason to dismiss him) is that he struggles to kill.  Not...really!  Some of Young Link's easiest moves to land (boomerang, dtilt, arrow and bomb) should mean a kill at 100% near the ledge, because they all combo generously into Fair and UpB.  Usmash is a frame 10 out-of-shield option that kills midweights at 120%. Dair kills midweights at 140%, and manages to surprise even good players with its frankly-too-big hitbox.  Yink's god-tier Nair (36 frames total, and FOUR TO TWENTY-SEVEN are active!) can edgeguard the majority of the cast, if not killing them from the stage at 120-160%.  And finally, Young Link's excellent zoning game allows him to consistently rack up damage, so well that getting to 160% (where most of his moves raw kill) is easier than many good characters getting him to 100%.&amp;#x200B;Your comments, feedback and wisdom are appreciated!  I'm also looking for potential secondaries that cover Young Link's weaknesses (such as Yoshi and Squirtle/PT to out-rushdown the rushdown characters), and any particularly good Young Link videos besides Tweek.  Thanks!"
"Is Alucard the only character represented in Smash to not use their main weapon?: The Alucard Assist Trophy uses Crissaegrim to attack its targets.Crissaegrim is a sword found in Castlevania Symphony of the Night as a rare random drop from an enemy in a non-essential area of the second half of the game. Alucard's main sword in the series is the Alucard Sword. He starts the game with this weapon, and while it is stolen by Death early on, Alucard can again find it after beating Death, in a room nearby the Death boss arena. This, along with its name, item description and high stats, gives the Alucard sword the most significance amongst Alucard's array of weapons.Additionally in Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, where Alucard appears as a bonus character, he uses only the Alucard sword with no option to change weapon, which implies that the Alucard Sword is his preferred weapon, even in cameo or non-main character appearances.So, why did they give the Assist Trophy Alucard the Crissaegrim instead?It's because Crissaegrim is infamous amongst Castlevania fans.Crissaegrim is the most ridiculously overpowered weapon in the game. It slashes rapidly multiple times per swing, with each slash dealing full damage. It has a really long reach, and additionally has no endlag and can even be used while walking. It's so absurdly strong, it shreds most bosses in an instant, and it's become infamous as the go-to example of how unbalanced SotN is overall.The fact that they gave the Alucard Assist Trophy the Crissaegrim, rather than Alucard's canon favoured weapon, is a gesture towards the fans of the game. It proves that the Smash Bros devs truly _understand_ the source material in the same way that the _fans_ understand it.It's like how the Guile Assist Trophy fights by just crouching and Flash Kicking when anyone approaches.  It's a reference to the ways the fans play the games, and not just to the game on its own.I love it. It proves how much care and attention each character got, including all of the non-playable characters."

Some that I've made are:Giant monsters: Special smash with heavy weight and mega size. Play as either bowser or donkey kong and have the enemy as the other one. Stage hazards off, items off, and do stages like fourside, tomodachi life, and safron city.Game demo: Pick a Nintendo game. Turn only items on from that game (i.e. if you pick super mario, only enable super star, fire flower, mushroom, etc.) Pick only stages from that game (i.e. mushroom kingdom, peach's castle, etc.) And do and pick characters as good vs. evil (Mario vs Bowser if you want to do solo, mario, yoshi, or peach vs bowser, bowser jr, and wario for a teams battle.)Do you ever make scenarios?

Got the double dunckers: 
"Smash Ultimate Character Viability in June 2019: https://m.imgur.com/PcWCPQaThis is a tier list based on Peak placements in PGRU tournaments that took place during the month of June. Here is the list of tournaments used from May 31st onwards to June 30th.https://www.ssbwiki.com/Summer_2019_PGRU*Tiers: S, A, B, and C.* Characters who placed top 12 in a S-Tier tournament go to the S tier. The same goes for those in the A, B, and C tiers. Characters ranked in C tier or higher prove to have some level of viability in big tournaments, of course depending on the type of tournament. For example, Yoshi in B tier means that it is proven in data that Yoshi has potential to win a B tier event. At higher levels however, it is not proven. *Tiers: D, E, and F.* When pro players make tier lists, it is usually expected for the mid and low tiers to be at least a little messed up, since most pro players play to win and don't know to much about mid tiers. This tier list is no exception. D tiers at least placed on the leaderboard at one of these selected tournaments as a player's main, while E tiers were not as well preforming, only placing on the leaderboard as a player's secandary.  F tiers had the worst results, or lack thereof, this month, not placing on the leaderboard in any big tournament.By leaderboard, I mean clicking on the tournament in smashwiki, and a certain number of players with the highest ranks in that tournaments are shown, but nobody else. The size of this leaderboard depends on the size of the tournament.*Conclusion* I reccomend that you should absolutely NOT take this as a definitive tier list. Huge outliers for example are Bowser and Isabelle. I main Bowser, and even I know his flaws. Not only is he combo food, but his vertical recovery is awful as well. Villager is already mediocre in this game, and Isabelle is just a watered down version of him. Most consider her bottom 10 or even 5. Most tier lists on results are only accurate in terms of ranking top tiers and high tiers (and maybe some mid tiers). Characters that are sparsly used are not shown to their fullest potential. That being said though, not only can this tier list can be a good guide in terms of what characters you should use if you are trying to enter tournaments, but it can also be a sign that some characters need help. The F tiers, Mewtwo, Marth, Corrin, and Junior, do need some buffs. Marth needs his tipper hitbox fixed, or he can at least deal more damage at the base so he is not completely helpless. Mewtwo does not need a tail hurtbox. He got a good amount of buffs in patch 3.0, but he needs his tail hurtbox removed. Junior is not the worst out there, but he needs a much better moveset fro hitboxes, power, and overall functionality. Corrin also got many buffs, but more kill power wouldn't hurt. When I said earlier that most pro players play to win, I mean it. Most of the time, characters are either picked or not picked in big tournaments becuase of their viability. The best characters are played, while the worst ones are neglected.Type in the comments what you think of this tier list."
"Multiple very important brackets from smash.gg have gone missing.: So, I was doing a lookthrough of brackets for future orionRank stuffs on smash.gg.

A lot of tournaments have yet to run Slippi, so these websites are a great resource for looking at what other Puff mains are doing right in a matchup that you may be struggling in."

"Using Special Smash to fix Ultimate.: Special Smash, or more specifically Heavy Smash. The physics changes that come along with this special setting make Ultimate feel a lot less floaty than standard matches.This may all be just because of my play style but having faster short hops, quicker air to ground combos and a faster pace generally makes Ultimate feel like something new, but with memories of past games.The biggest downside to this mode however is physics based recoveries. Some are incredibly gimped (Sonic and Duck Hunt Duo come to mind), making some characters essentially have no recovery or a lot more challenging of one at the very least.If like me you are longing for something to change up the game slightly, i highly recommend trying Heavy Smash. Imo it is the best we'll get until Project NX."

Putting the OP in optimal: 
Penn State University Spring 2019 Power Rankings [SSBM}: 
I think Hungrybox is lowkey talking about himself here: 
"Nintendo's hands-off attitude towards eSports, pro or con?: Like most publishers with multiplayer games these days, Nintendo has  placed a big focus on eSports with Splatoon, ARMS, and Super Smash Bros.  Ultimate. Unlike most publishers though, Nintendo stays pretty hands off with the competitive scenes for their games. They'll endorse events  like EVO and Apex, they'll host their own competitions at E3, and market  these scenes when they can. But they won't contribute to the prize pool, or have any real league that sets up a series of rules and pay-rates for Pro Players. Instead they leave all that stuff up to the  community.    It's an unorthodox approach, especially considering that for a long  time, they tried to dissociate themselves from eSports. But it's one  that has its benefits. A community driven approach means the rules and legalities of the scene are generally dictated by the players, not the publisher. It also allows the community to form their own culture and  identity instead of a culture manufactured by the league the publisher  wants to market. However, it also means pro players of Smash and  Splatoon earn a lot less than players of other eSports titles, as Nintendo's lack of financial involvement means their pay is coming out of the community's pocket.    I do think Nintendo should provide something for the prize-pool as it be  better than nothing. On the other hand, I can appreciate their decision  to let the community drive the competitive scenes for their games. It's a refreshing change of pace from the commercialized approaches of  Capcom and Activision."
Does This Community Even Care About Tournament Spoilers?: Legitimately curious if this is a thing people are worried about being spoiler tagged or not.
"Did the smell situation somehow improve at recent tournaments?: I remember seeing a lot of talk about how gaming tournaments tend to have really bad smell coming from the players, which is especially proeminent in Smash tourneys. I've experienced this about two years ago while going to a local tournament, but since then, I never stepped into one, so I was wondering if the problem got any better."
"Sony Representative Speculation: There are still 2 slots for DLC characters, and so far all of them have been Third-party characters, could Sony get a representative?Personally when I think about a Sony Representative, few characters come to mind, but the ones who stand out the most to me are Ratchet from the Ratchet&amp;Clank Series, Jak from the Jak&amp;Daxter Series and Sly from the Sly Cooper series.What about you?Edit: SackBoy from Little Big Planet could also be an interesting representative"

Do people host Beginners/Intermediate tournaments or chill play sessions in DE?: I’m in the north Delaware area and relatively new to the smash scene. I want to try to meet people in my area to play against and learn from to try to get better and have a bit of fun. Is there’s anywhere that often holds these kinds of things in Northern Delaware?
"So what's stalling?: I see that term thrown around all the time and apparently there are tournaments with anti-stalling rules that define it like ""purposefully not playing the game"" but that sounds super weird to me, since running away from the opponent and avoiding conflict is part of the game after all. It's an option one can use to his advantage, hence part of the game. Just doing nothing while the timer runs out can be to one's advantage too, in rare cases even if one is behind simply to take a break or to leave the opponent less time to answer once you do get lead back.&amp;#x200B;So at which point is any in-game action considered ""purposefully not playing the game""?"
"What is spam do you hate the most, and with what character?: Spammers we know, we seen them, we probably were one of them once, but it is super annoying regardless of what character, but all of us probably have one spam type we hate the most, so what move spam do you hate the most? Examples would be special, aerials, jabs and more. Remember state your reason of hating that type of spam. My answer would be Special spam, Young Link, ultimate. Why? Young Link already is my least favorite character to go up against, he has frame data, high damage output, powerful aerials, and over all he is just annoying to go up against."

"Sword type/close up type countermeasures?: I've recently started playing smash ultimate alot after I finally decided to get it a couple days ago and I've gotten pretty decent at it. But I really struggle with characters like Ryu or cloud or any of the other characters who use swords or close up quick attacks. I mainly use inkling currently, but I've started using captain falcon cause of spirit mode. But no matter who I choose whenever I fight someone like for example cloud who is the most recent ""new Challenger"" I can't beat him. I probably could if I used link, but I'd prefer to use someone else. I like link but he's too easy to use. But whenever I try and beat someone like cloud his attacks always happen before I can do anything. I know that the CPU can be a lvl 9 cause I completed a challenge for defeating a level 9 cpu after a new Challenger was defeated. So I know it isn't just cause I'm not good at it I know it's also supposed to be a challenge. But I really struggle with attacks like the ones sword users use. And it honestly feels like it's complete bs how they seem to be able to defeat me so easily. Any tips at all on how to do better against those types would help. Specifically for inklink(and any other character if you think the advice would still help). I appreciate the help."

Focusing your question on a more specific part of a character’s toolkit, such as “what makes Diddy Kong’s banana so strong?” is a question that will generate focused discussion on the front page. * **Does my question give information about my situation?** The more specific and focused a question is, the more likely it is to be allowed as a thread. “How do I beat Pikachu” is a very open-ended question that gives no information about OP as a player, and belongs in this thread. “As a Lucina main, how do I seal out a stock against Pikachu (Ultimate)” is the sort of question we like to see on the front page, because it focuses discussion on your specific situation. Generally, let us know which characters you play, which parts of a matchup you struggle with or which moves you don’t know how to use, and what level of player you are.* **Does my question have an objective right answer?** If your question is something that has a definite answer, such as “is Melee Falco’s down air safe on shield,” it doesn’t belong in its own thread.

So I have a question. Is Bayo complete: So me and my friends have been playing smash since 4. However one of my friends is a bayo main. Last night i defeated his bayo with my kirby and he got really salty. He started complain about bayo being trash. He specifically stated that bayo cant beat kirby because of his couch. I repeat his fucking crouch. I dont play bayo but cant bayo do like a down tilt to pressure him? I dont fucking know at this point. One day he started to complain about how Isabelle is stupid because of her roid dash and fishing rod. At this point I dont know. Is there anyway to convince him that Bayo is not complete trash.

Like do I need to go to the Nintendo website and do something? Is there a step I’m missing here? Any help would be appreciated."

"How to stop Richter's Down air from being a spike: I am new to smash Bros and wanted to get into Richter, cause why the hell not he's a vampire hunter. So while in training I was trying out some combos with his down air but found out it will Spike and completely ruin my combo! Is there a way to stop it from spiking?"
"Help me learn how to punish: Hey guys so I'm trying to working on getting reads on opponents and punishing. I feel like at the level I'm in (\~4.8mil. gotten to elite couple times and dropped. I know this does not mean a lot but just an idea of what kind of opponents I play ), people are somewhat predictable (e.g this wario always recovered high and always went down from air using down a). Unfortunately that does not always lead to me converting it. Often times I end up losing because I focus too much on punishing my opponent that I play worse than I normally would or I end up missing timing and getting damage for missing punish. &amp;#x200B;Which character are good to learn to punish? Should I just try to punish every single read I have? any help is appreciated. I main joker and Yoshi but I think maybe I should try other characters to learn to how punish. what do you think?"
"Bayonetta appears to have the wrong eye color in one of her victory screens: In both of her games, [Bayonetta has light blue eyes.](https://imgur.com/lLIpHuF) She also has blue eyes in Smash Ultimate in her render and in-game model, as expected. However, during one of her three victory screens, she seems to have brown eyes instead of blue.Here is the victory screen with brown eyes:[Classic Bayonetta alt](https://imgur.com/lgVVZzn)[Bayonetta 2 alt](https://imgur.com/54hIdgo)And lastly, [here](https://imgur.com/E0zmpco) is a picture of one of her other victory screens, where her eyes are clearly blue. The same, of course, applies to her Bayonetta 2 look.I just thought this was strange and decided to share. Has anyone else caught this or talked about it? At first I thought it was just the angle that made them look brown, but they definitely look way darker here.Edit: Sorry for the not-so-great quality. Here are some closer images of the brown eyes:[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/uV6vTCL) [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/hUlCCIe)"

"Neutral Dominant Characters?: I'm looking for some secondaries and maybe even to find a character that I would be interested as picking up as a primary.

Any reasoning and suggestions for characters would be appreciated."

"Character attributes?: I finally bought Smash Bros ultimate a day or two ago and I've gotten decently far into spirit mode, but there are some things that aren't explained super clearly. Certain spirits give elemental attacks like fire or water and all the other types a boost. I don't know which characters use which type, it might just be neutral if it isn't obviously fire or another elemental attack but I'm not sure. I'm hoping someone has a link to some website that has all that information or can explain it if it's obvious and I just don't know."
"EVO 2019 Announcement expectations: After CEO wraps up this week, the biggest FGC tournament is upon us. EVO. The lineup was revealed earlier this year and for the first time in a long time, there is only one Smash game taking the main event, Ultimate. Last year, Nintendo announced a Smash Ultimate Direct for August 8th following the Melee Grand Finals. This year, with more DLC coming, what do you think they'll announce following Ultimate's GFs? I think we'll get a release date for Hero alongside a highlight Video about some new stuff coming to 4.0.As for 4.0 itself. I really want Targets and Home Run to return for starters. 3.0 brought Stage Builder back, so we need these back too."

I know new fighters are every couple of months but is there other quality of life stuff being added?2. will they ever change the ranking in the game to a tier instead? gold, silver, bronze3. besides spirits are there other things coming to the game? new music, new skins4. did they mention any plans of expanding ranked to 2 v 2 mode or something?"

"Samus player? Try this Samus-only obstacle course!: Is made just for Samus (and Dark Samus I guess), is a bit tricky since you need to know some air bomb and grapple mobility tricks. Is not too long, just 3 main sections with checkpoints in between, since she can do very long jumps and have some above average air time, even the big stage is barely big enough.You need to get to the elevator on the top left of the stage, and that's it (there isn't a way to ""end"" the stage).Have fun! (Or get frustrated, idk).ID: 75S6G2PRLet me know if you manage to get to the elevator with another character :P"
Protobanham with the sickest Inkling edgeguard: 
"I love how unique the Links are: I think it's so amazing how the three Links, despite having similar movesets, manage to feel and play completely differently, and at the same time all be great characters.Young Link oppresses his opponent with his speed and fast projectiles, then gets one hit and goes in for a combo.Toon Link plays tricky in neutral, then once he finds his opening he goes in for a big combo.Normal Link walls out his opponent and pressures their shield, then uses his openings to get his opponents offstage to edgeguard them.Obviously that's an oversimplification, but my point still stands - they're three incredibly different characters, even though their moves may not be all that different."

"[Discussion] ""Characters"" in the Roster: So I have been trying to figure out the number of ""characters"" in the Smash Roster. What I mean by that, is not thenumber of fighters, but the number of different characters represented in the fighters roster. So the fighter count is 74. But Ice Climbers represent two characters, (Popo &amp; Nana), Kid Bowser has a different character for every skin, PK Trainer has 5 characters (Red, Green, Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard), and Ralph. Duck Hunt Dog is technically three characters (Duck, Dog, and you with the zapper) Which brings the total to 89ish. Not to mention that The Hero will bring four separate protagonist and Banjo Kazooie are two seperate characters.But, there are a lot of characters where this becomes a harder question to answer. Like what about other characters that have different genders? (Corrin, Pikachu, Villager, Robin, Inkling, Wii Fit Trainer) While the FE characters seem to fall under the umbrella of the same character in the story umbrella I don't play a lot of fire emblem games so I need community support for this one. Wii Fit Trainer also brings up an interesting line of debate as in their games they will appear with one another and don't exist as the same protagonist of their games like the other mentioned.Let's not forget fighters that have different skins based off of different characters (different colored Yoshis (Plus Crafter World Yoshi), four swords links, Dark Link, Fierce Deity Link, Claus (Lucas' twin brother with Orange hair), Pikachu and Pichu's alts being different canonical characters all together. Little Mac vs. Arcade mode Mac? Wario from his solo series &amp; Mario series? Metaknights new skins (specifically Galacta Knight)?What about the reverse. Are Dr. Mario and Mario the same character? Should we count Mii's as one character or none? (As the different bracnhes have taken on a life of their own and are 3 different ""characters"" at this point. What about Zelda and Sheik? (Most agree that these are different versions of the character at this point. Zero Suit Samus and Samus are definitely the same character.What about characters that exist as part of the move set? Toad with Peach, Petey Piranha with PP, Ganon, Gordo, Other Star Fighters in their final Smashes, Don't get me started on Mr. Game &amp; Watch (Flagman, Judge, Lion tamer, Octopus, Chef are all the same character?) The different Pikman? (Red, Blue, Yellow, White, and Purple all have different pages on a Nintendo wiki, are they not an individual character?), DH bringing out the wild Gunman. Morgana from Persona?"

NEW GLITCHES in Patch 3.1.0 - Smash Ultimate (by OHKO): 
Smash Ultimate Mods?: I know that some mods are coming out for Ultimate. And I know some are unsafe especially for online play. Does anyone know if something permanent could happen because of a clean mod (does not hurt your console with viruses etc) like getting permanently banned from online play or even something else severe?
"Over/Underrated things about Smash Ultimate meta?: I'll start us off. Underrated: Zoning characters. Projectile characters are immensely strong and zoning is incredibly oppressive, especially at the local competitive meta. The vast majority of players in my local scene either play a zoner or play a swordie rushdown to counter zoners. Not being able to cancel dash with shield is huge. Unless you're playing a top tier or a reflector, you need a secondary to deal with zoners. Camping is far too rampant in the meta."

Is there any site to bet real money on smash matches: I'm looking for melee bets in particular.If there is no such thing would you be interested ?
"How to get the SSBU character select screen background?: I'm trying to get the background of the select screen to use for an art collaboration where everyone draws their own characters to add to it, but all I can find are templates that are hard to edit and have way too many slots. So I was wondering if anyone had the background image or something close to it, or at least knows how I would go about getting it."
"Axe's recent victory summit has had me thinking, what do you guys think are some mid to low-tier character with untapped potential in melee?: In my opinion, the sickest thing about melee is that it is unchangeable- no buffs or nerfs, years upon years of learning tech that defies the way in which the game was intended to be played etc etc. If a player manages to discover new tech and do well enough with a character to bump them up in the tier-list, it's a glorious feat. Don't get me wrong, I love watching the pros play the top-tiers, but god damn is it satisfying to see Axe take it with pikachu. So, hypothetically, if someone was able to play X character with robot-like precision, who do you think has the potential to jump up in the tier-list or act as a reliable secondary at the very least?I reckon Young Link could become pretty great. I'm a sucker for a jancky-ass kit like his, but he's got speed on his side, he can control space with clever use of projectiles. Axe has proven that he can be played well aggressively, compared to Armada's campy style- his recovery is also looking really good. With more time dedicated to learning the best projectile combos in any given situation, 100IQ bomb placement to bait the opponent and general survivability, I think he could go further. He's obviously very light, and he has a hard time getting the kill, so I can't see him being a reliable main but I think that he could be a very solid secondary... I think his potential goes further than 'can beat Puff'. A brilliant YL could beat Puff, Peach, Pikachu, Ice Climbers, Yoshi, Luigi and both Marios (I won't list characters generally deemed weaker than him).ANYWAY I'm interested to see who you guys think is underrated or underdeveloped, and why."
"Any good guides to learn pac man’s bonus fruits and how to use them?: I’ve gotten down most of his normal combos and learned how to manipulate the hydrant, but I’m still confused on how to use his bonus fruits. I know what they each do, but I can’t really figure out how to string the fruit throws into a combo."
"Just gonna say it, we should be able to make and share custom spirit battles.: The spirits themselves could either have given effects or be purely collectible like fighter spirits."
"PSA: Quitting after losing STILL penalizes you.: Not much to be said, looked to reply in a topic already on the subject but they're all archived.  I literally never quit games, and I'm always puzzled why I'm matched with people that do, yet here I am being lectured and penalized for leaving a game after I lost.  I'm NOT waiting 15 minutes for the match to end when the other 2 players have 2+ stocks.  Some of these topics have 2k+ upvotes, how does Nintendo not get this?? Similar reasons are why I stopped playing online in January.  Guess the same problems still exist.Edit: So let me rephrase, if I die in a stock based battle, and the enemy(ies) have 2+ lives, and it's FFA, I'm not staying around.  I'll watch my teammate, but team based battles must be a 'niche' gametype nowadays."

"Does anyone know where I can join an online, low level tournament?: So I enjoy playing Smash but I'm not a pro level player.

"Final Smash via Rage (ala Tekken 7)?: So for those that don't know, Bandai Namco had a large involvement in Smash4's development and since Tekken 6 had a similar Rage mechanic we can assume that's where the mechanic originated from. Tekken 7 subsequently had a rage mechanic too. &amp;#x200B;Rage was poorly implemented into Smash4 and imo makes the game frustrating to place since kill confirms became inconsistent. It didn't help that we couldn't even see when it activated or know about whatever the hell those tiers were. The nerf in Ultimate was extremely welcome but it still feels like a half baked feature that has me thinking WHY even have it there. And that maybe smash (for competitive atleast) would be better without it and just have damage work like in pre-Smash4. &amp;#x200B;But recently I picked up Tekken 7, it's a fun game. What I was most surprised about was how Rage is used there. So of course there's the ""Rage starts once a threshold is reached in healthbar, get's stronger with lower health"" but what I didn't realize was the Rage Arts. During rage you can activate two types of special moves. One is like a final smash, it plays a cutscene and does big damage that can potential kill the other player with enough Rage stacked up. The other is just a super powered move. Neither are a guaranteed auto win button as you can correctly space/block/punish them. And then the kicker: you lose Rage after using either of those Rage Art moves meaning you lose the damage boost. This creates a really nice risk/reward dynamic. &amp;#x200B;It had me thinking like damn, why wasn't that added into Ultimate? The Final Smash Meter was a nice addition in theory, but it really it doesn't add cool dynamic to the game as you are just waiting to eventually getting your FS to use it. &amp;#x200B;And so, what if Ultimate had an option where rage worked like Tekken 7? Essentially, just like in Tekken 7, when a character gets into rage state they are given the ability to use their Final Smash. BUT they lose their rage state after using it. &amp;#x200B;Also as an additional thought, for this theoretical option have Rage be more substantial but instead of the stupid ass Smash4 tier implementation they did just have it be an exponential multiplier that's based on the whole number percentage that goes up to 999%. As I would see this option more for fun, thus a good way for experimentation with more powerful rage with the risk of losing it if you mess up your FS.&amp;#x200B;Like I honestly see this as the best possible way of implementing the Final Smashes into competitive play and to see if Rage is even needed in comp smash. BUT ofc it could end up being incompatible with comp, so at the very least I see this as something that can be really a fun option for the party setting compared to the lackluster Final Smash Meter. &amp;#x200B;~~(also an option to turn off rage and just give everyone a flat damage boost but that's another story ;P)~~"

"Are you happy with how projectiles turned out in Ultimate?: So there is one thought that pops up every single time when Im playing Ultimate. Some projectiles are just too good. Last week I was playing Smash4 again for 2 days. I was very pleased that there were still people playing it online. But what also surprised me: When I was playing against Link, his boomerang animation was super slow and laggy, I could have punished it with litterally anything. And there was a bowser using fire breath. I was laughing hard how easily i was able to jump over it to punish him instead of getting stuck in the middle and destroying me for 50%.Im maining Roy btw in both games. Of course Im not a big fan of projectiles since roy doesnt even have a projectile of his own or a reflector. But I remembered that when Smash4 was still the latest Smash Bros, almost everyone was complaining about projectiles. But if you look at Smash4 projectiles, they were a big joke in comparison to ultimate projectiles. So why isn't the ourtrage greater against projectile spam now? Became everyone a fan of it? Do they find it actually hype that the pikas get a guaranteed grab, if the thunderjolt is hitting their shield? Or that young Links Boomerang is 100% safe on shield (atleast roy cant punish it lol), even with the worst spacing there is?I dont want to take it that way, that I want to nerf every projectile to the ground. Hell no. But without further ado, I just wanted to ask the following: Is it really okay, that most projectiles have very little risk and are effective even in the hands of a noob? Young Links Fire Arrows for example. You litterally just have to mash the B Button, and it easily becomes one of the most annoying things I encountered in my whole gaming career. Young Link isnt broken or anything, but this move (+the boomberang) itself is a SSS+ Tier move.In my opinion this is really boring game design, because there is no reason not to spam fire arrows all the thime. It would be better if they nerfed fire arrows and give him something else. He just isnt a complete character. And thats why so many characters in this game lack kinda depth and are not very fun because of over-centralizing moves. But this is a whole other topic"

"/r/Smashbros 25 Best in 25 Days, Summer 2019, Day 4.: Welcome back to /r/Smashbros's 25 best in 25 days, Yesterday(haha yes), Axe won the race to 3rd in the largest margin of victory yet, beating out Leffen 55-13. So far, every placing has lined up with Untitled's list which is mildly disappointing to me, but ultimately unsurprising. One surprise, though, was that iBDw made it into the poll, he is now up for voting! [Vote here!](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/vote.pl?id=E_6b7fa3f9151418a1&amp;akey=6267e16406ca9300)Here's how it works: Every day there will be a poll with 6 options, which you will rank in order of which you think is the best of the options, to the worst of the options. After 24 hours, the polls will close and a winner will be chosen. They will then be replaced by another player in the following day's poll. In order for a player to make it in the poll, someone must nominate them in the comment section. Whoever has the most upvoted nomination makes it in the following day.This idea was inspired by u/newbzoors series, [2015's 30 best in 30 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3vylz4/rsmashbross_30_best_in_30_days_day_1/).List so far:1)  **Envy|Wizzrobe** [CaptainFalcon](#MeleeCaptainFalcon)2) [Team Liquid](#SponsorTL) **Hungrybox** [Jigglypuff](#MeleeJigglypuff)3) [Tempo Storm](#SponsorTempo) **Axe** [Pikachu](#MeleePikachu)Sorry for the gap, guys, currently in the middle of travelling and on my way back home, so in like 2 days it'll be consistent."

"Distracting Backgrounds: Does anyone else have trouble focusing on the characters? I've been playing Smash for probably 15 years now and I've never had any sort of visual issues. With Smash Ultimate however, I'm finding myself struggling to make out what is going on in any of my matches, and I think it's due to the detailed backgrounds and colors they used (even on old maps.) Any suggestions?"

"I really hope a patch differentiates Peach and Daisy in a distinct but balanced way: With many echoes being fundamentally different in a few ways, like Villager/Isabelle with their specials, Marth/Lucina and Roy/Chrom with tipper mechanics, Ryu/Ken with...well, a lot really...Mario/Dr. Mario, etc. etc.I would hope that Peach and Daisy get separated in a similar way soon. When the turnip knockback thing was discovered, I was like “oh, so that’s the difference”, but then they patched it out, implying that was not actually intentional. So in the end, they seem to be the only echoes that aren’t different, and I’m wondering if the team ever plans to make them different. It would be nice for consistency and broaden the choices per matchup of every Peach/Daisy main."
"Classic Route Creator?: What if you could create your own custom Classic Mode routes and share them and download them online for different characters? Basically, having enough freedom as far as being able to play a track from one series to a stage of a different series. Also, you would be permitted to use one Boss character per route, whether at the end or being the penultimate battle.&amp;#x200B;My idea for Ryu would basically be the 1P Game from the original Smash, but in the form of stamina battles, in the same order as the original, penultimate fight being against Metal Mario and Final Round being the fight with Master Hand to the track from the original Final Destination.&amp;#x200B;I'd call it, ""Ultra Smash Fighter 64"", a reference to Ultra Street Fighter IV as well as the N64's original name, Nintendo Ultra 64."

"FFA with items is supposed to be endless fun right?

Smash Bros Cypher REMIX!: 
"Here's the endlag for every characters' throw in frames. I hope it proves useful to you.: This was all tested starting on the frame of release knockback for the opponent. It's effectively the ending lag of the throw's ""attack"", lower means more time to chase or even combo. Also note that low ending lag might not guarantee a combo if the opponent's release point is far away, which can be seen on many back throws, but it does allow you to chase opponents if they land on a platform.Some throws are weight dependent, to account for this I've selected a fighter with a weight of 100 to test this on; Cloud/Mii Swordfighter.Hitstun in this game is tricky; when they first start to launch with the smoke trails, it'll be around 31 frames of hitstun. This will slowly scale as knockback rises until settling around 42 frames—the frame in which opponents can start cancelling with an airdodge. It can slowly can rise from there, but it'll be impossible to chase at that point.Please keep in mind that some of these may be a frame off.

"How I learned to tech consistently, and how you can too !: If you're not familiar with the term ""tech"" in smash ultimate (and other smash games), you can watch  [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ltH1CwCcM) to learn about this technique. It's pretty important and can make the difference between winning and losing a game.&amp;#x200B;Now this isn't a particularly complicated technique to pull off, even for an average player like me. I'm pretty sure a lot of people can go in training mode, set a bot to forward smash in front of a wall, and surely after a few minutes will manage to consistently tech. In real matches, teching off a Falcon or Ganondorf up B for instance is fairly easy to do, as you have time to react to it.&amp;#x200B;The real difficulty of being able to consistently pull off techs in real games, at least in my opinion, is to EXPECT an attack to hit you towards a wall, and to be READY for it. Most of the time after I got hit and forgot to tech, resulting in me dying, I asked myself ""Why didn't I tech? I should have been expecting this!"". But I did not. And it kept happening.&amp;#x200B;So granted the main difficulty here is to always have the possibility of needing to tech (especially offstage) in mind, I asked myself ""How can I make sure that I don't forget to tech when I know I would be capable of doing so if I expected it ? ""&amp;#x200B;I found a simple solution that worked for me, and may work for you too! I started using [this online stopwatch](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/loop-countdown/) to set an alarm that goes off every 15 seconds. I told my brain to associate this alarm with the need to tech. So every time the alarm goes off during a game, I tell myself ""Oh right, I need to think about teching in case I get offstage!"". I've been experimenting this technique for a few days, and man it drastically improved the number of techs I was able to pull off. Just try it, it's really simple and could improve your gameplay by a fair bit :)&amp;#x200B;I hope it will help some of you getting better at the game! Peace"

"Ultimate feels so barebones in comparison to melee: Melee's classic mode just feels more unique and its just WAY more fun, it has cinematics, it has the zelda dungeon, break the targets, the fucking stage where you have to get to the finish line, THE METROID THING, the stage where you kick the trophies, the thing where you kick the marshmallow, they got the hologram characters, the all star isnt just here are 70 guys kill them, melee actually has a stage for every character, it even has a fucking lobby for fucks sake, im sorry but you're just not gonna see that on ultimate, on there the classic mode is like  ""hey heres a dude kill him... ok heres another"" imo they should add the melee classic mode and adventure as a dlc"

"With Wizzrobe’s signing, who do you think are the best free agents atm?: I feel like with SKT’s signings, and now Wizzrobe being picked up, that there aren’t too many undervalued free agents. Just curious who you guys think deserves to be sponsored/signed who isn’t already. SSBU and melee. Thoughts?"
"What are your dream buffs to your favorite lower tiers?: I really like zelda personally, but she's more of a casual stomper in this game (better than in the last games tho). I feel like if they just buff her fair and bair to have less lag, she'd be more viable in competitive without being completely ridiculous casually.What would you like to see for your favorites?"

"The Large-Scale Effect of Community Toxicity: Earlier today, a post was made here by u/T51bwinterized that many people seemingly dismissed about recent issues that have occurred, the most recent and primary example being the loss of content creator Etika. It discussed what has been occurring that has lead to said events, and also suggested a few ways to start moving to help. Highly recommend you read it, it is perhaps a bit wordy but in the long run well worth it:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/c686nu/our\_house\_is\_on\_fire/](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/c686nu/our_house_is_on_fire/) I'll keep my post here simple. All of the things pointed out there are true. And the ideas that were there are fantastic. I want to target specifically the real issue behind it all though; ourselves. That may sound weird to say, especially if you're someone who actually hasn't done any harm. That's just it though; we all probably think we've done nothing wrong. From our end, it looks like nothing, because we aren't the ones getting hurt. But there are real people on the other side of each insulting post about how you hate the character someone plays, or for each time you tweet a picture of Etika in clown makeup. Look where that got us. It's not going to push us any further onward if we don't change the root of it all. And real people get harmed for it. Each ""Boo!"" in the crowd of a major tournament, or each hateful comment of a YouTube video will always leave more of an impact than you expect it to as the consumer. I'm not going in here expecting this post to cause any waves, or for everyone who has done wrong to see it, but this is the largest scale it will see anything at in terms of what I can do, so if you see this, please, share it, upvote it and let this post be a wake-up call to us all; what you do and say as a person is not meaningless, for better or for worse. Think before you speak, on all platforms, from Twitter to Twitch to Reddit; will this be hurtful to someone? Can someone take offense to this? Don't enable the bad. The effects can be more drastic than you would imagine.TLDR: Life isn't a joke, so be a nice person, because being bad does nobody any good."

"Is it possible to save match replays in 20XX Training Hack Pack?: I got a really cool combo playing against a CPU (Falco v. Fox), but I don't have a setup to record footage from my modded wii. I know 20XX TE has the functionality to save match replays after they're played, so I was wondering if it would be possible to do the same? I already won and was kicked back to the CSS :("

"Link Notes/Guide: Smash Ultimate: I would like to share my notes I have been taking on Link. I have recently picked up this character and am having a great time! Please feel free to discuss, critique, and add your two cents to anything that comes to mind, especially the Link match-ups section. Also, another reminder to join the character Smashcord servers!# Smash Ultimate: Link**Fundamentals of Link \[From The Link Discord\]**1. BnB's (Bread &amp; Butters). DThrow combos, boomerang combos, DTilt combos, BAir extensions, mixups, etc \[see VinS and srAk\].2. Item Efficiency. ZAC &amp; IZAC optimizations and how to trap opponents with projectiles in the neutral \[see Sillintor, Salem, and Prand Grix\].3. Bomb Recovery. Includes mastery of all different methods, instant bomb recovery is the BEST by far if mastered \[see Lonesome, Orange, and LxZ\].4. Edgeguarding. Using combinations of projectiles / aerials offstage to bait airdodges and limit options to potentially secure the stock. Difficulty of edgeguard gets harder depending on character and takes precision \[see Arrow and T.JACK\]5. Ledgetrapping. Often used in combination with bomb bounced on ledge to cover a multitude of options simultaneously. Often used when there is no time to edgeguard, lack of confidence in edgeguarding, or the character you're edgeguarding against is too difficult to perform on.6. Out Of Shield Attacks. Includes spin attack, USmash, NAir, BAir, OoS. Choice of the OoS is important because one may have an advantage depending on scenario.7. Spacing. From safely spaced sword moves (FAir 2, DTilt, pivot FTilt) to zone breaking with a cross up NAir (preferably hard NAir) \[see Rido, Javi, Izaw, and LinkEa\]# Tips**Tips: Neutral**1. UpTilt is a great follow up after Nair/Bair landings!2. For full hop, fast fall before Bair. For short hop, FF after Bair. FH -&gt; FF -&gt; Bair. SH -&gt; Bair -&gt; FF.3. Soft Nair Techchase \~80%4. Point blank DTilt offers best combos, but very unsafe5. Fair1 is awful. Unsafe in shield &amp; requires bad spacing to land combos**Tips: Edgeguarding**1.

"How do you go off stage as Wolf?: I would like to play him more, but I like to play off stage when I edge guard. They give Wolf a pretty strong stage spike, but I find it's not worth the risk going just a little bit off stage to use it, since he has a -1/10 recovery, and I seem to get gimped by any sour spot hit box at any percent.&amp;#x200B;Is it best just to play really campy, or does anyone know any tricks to not die every time you step off the ledge as Wolf? All I have gathered is to not go far, and never fast fall."

"I calculated every single Smash character's total character placement throughout the series via tier placement score: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lrJyKORNvWfo0\_0IfWlj0-aAt7ZbjTHlsQyIZ427Zbc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lrJyKORNvWfo0_0IfWlj0-aAt7ZbjTHlsQyIZ427Zbc/edit?usp=sharing)For the first four games, I used the official tier lists on the Smash Wiki. For Ultimate, I used this:[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\_E8EJm6QOMs1cbXDlhcz7Tza8MqyZU9gZVJIa25T2qo/edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_E8EJm6QOMs1cbXDlhcz7Tza8MqyZU9gZVJIa25T2qo/edit)There's multiple tier lists, and I wanted it to be as accurate as possible so I stuck to the Alt Ordered tier list which is strictly 3.1.0. I didn't use the regular Alternate because the top would've just been a bunch of ties. Anyways, what is a tier score? It's the number used to determine a character's performance throughout Smash history purely via tier placings. It's calculated by simply dividing their placing by the amount of characters in each game. They're then added up with all the rest and the mean is found; what results is the character's tier score. Here, lower is better. For example, Brawl Meta Knight is 1st out of 38 characters in Brawl. 1/38=0.026, which is what his Brawl tier score is. The absolute worst of their game will receive a score of 1.Here's some things of note:\-1st place is Joker. Because his one and only appearance was in ultimate, He receives a 0.028 tier score.\-1st place veteran is Snake, with a tier score of 0.086.\-Last place is King K. Rool, with his only appearance having him be the second worst. He receives a 0.986 tier score.\-Last place veteran is Bowser Jr. with a tier score is 0.895.\-Pokemon Trainer is one character because both the Brawl and Ultimate tier lists list him as such.\-Because the Mii Fighters were not placed in the Sm4sh tier list, they're treated as newcomers in Ultimate, pretty much.\-24/38 in Brawl is...Zelda and Sheik combined. Brawl's tier list is the only one that has the two in one slot, so they were not given a tier score.\-In the Sm4sh official tier list, ties occurred and both characters shared one ranking. For Pit and Dark Pit however, that was not the case despite them having the exact same score, saying ""32-33"". I decided to make both of them 32nd.\-The best Original 12 member was Pikachu, with a tier score of 0.190.\-The worst Original 12 member was Jigglypuff, with a tier score of 0.714.\-Kirby is apparently the worst character in two separate games. While this might change in the future, it's grim for you, Kirby mains. Sucks.\-The single largest drop from one game to the next is Kirby from Sm64sh to Melee, where his tier score plummeted by 0.833. Yikes.Right now, there might be some errors and mistakes that I missed so please, if you spot any, tell me in the comments. I also might've missed mentioning some things and questions may arise.Characters haven't been ranked yet because I want to wait for ZeRo's tier list to finish and because I'm lazy (okay, solely because I'm lazy), so you'll see it ranked soon....if I do it before any of you.This will very obviously change as new updates and new tier lists release, but this is current as of about 40 minutes before midnight in Midwest United States at June 26, 2019.This took a bit of time."

ZeRo's Smash Ultimate Tier List 3.1.0 Part 2: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=erJkfsowPvk
Nairo and Tweek moving with PT on elite smash: 
How do I deal with Peach’s ledge pressure?: So I just fought it a local and I got beaten by the same peach twice. I found myself getting stuck at the ledge a bunch. I got hit with a million down smashes and turnips. What is the safest way to get back in the edge against peach? I was playing Lucina btw.
"20XX Dolphin Frame Loss Constant and False Inputs: I've run out of options at this point. Both me and my friend are just trying to netplay 20xx but we always get consistent frame loss and inputs are so slow. For example if I try to click Y and A at the same time to N-air on my Gamecube controller it just jumps and if i tap Y nothing happens so I can't short hop. Same thing happens to him too and we both have brand new Gamecube controllers and Nintendo Adapters. I have a 1660 TI so I don't understand why my frames drop so much to the point where I can't play anymore. It's really annoying for me when i try to do any aerial, tilt, or even dash as they aren't ever working properly. Any tips are appreciated."
"Wavebird controller lag?: I want to train my skills in Smash and the first thing to do for that is to know how to consistently short hop.  Although it's extremely hard, I can do it for 10 seconds with a Pro Controller. But I want to use a GameCube controller. All I have is 2 Wavebird controllers and I use [this](https://www.amazon.ca/Mayflash-GameCube-Controller-Adapter-Switch/dp/B00RSXRLUE) as an adapter to make them work on Switch. They work but I noticed they lag a lot and playing with them just feels weird.  So does the Wavebird have a lot of lag? Should I get another controller? Which one?"
"Where to send my clips?: I've been gathering up some of my best clips, and I want to send them to people so that maybe they can be put in compilations and montages online. However, I don't know who I should be sending them to. I posted on a different subreddit asking the same question, but the one response I managed to get said I should make my own montages, commission people to make them for me, or appear on streams and get clipped that way. This is all good advice, I guess, but it didn't really answer the question.So, where can I send my best clips, and how?"
"Ultimate saves corrupted out of nowhere.: I've been saving and uploading clips in Ultimate for months now, and just suddenly yesterday when I try to use the saved mp4s on my computer the files are corrupt and not useable. I can view them fine but I cant upload them anywhere.I've never changed SD cards and actually successfully uploaded a video about 30 minutes prior to the first time I saved a corrupt one. Any ideas on how to fix this would be massively helpful because I use these videos for content creation."
"Getting better offline vs online: So I started going to locals last month. I’ve done decently well, not having gone 0-2 yet. I play a lot online in arenas, finding good players and streaming myself so that I can rewatch the vods, get tips from viewers who give me a challenge, etc. My fear is that I’m just improving my online play, not my offline play. I’m new to the scene in my area so I don’t have anyone to practice offline with. Does training offline mechanics translate if I’m playing online? Or am I not going to improve offline play unless I find a partner? Thanks!"
Banjo-Kazooie artist ‘surprised Nintendo didn’t change Smash design’: 
"Since the upcoming CEO 2019 tournament has its own wrestling PPV, let's create our own using Smash characters.: Just state the match, stipulation, and winner. You can also include the match finish and some promos throughout the card as well. Here's mine:It should be noted that all of the Fire Emblem characters are in a heel faction and have been teasing a new member which is something to keep in mind. Marth is the leader. This means that in game heroes could be heels and in-game villains could be faces. In fact, Ganondorf and Bowser are a popular face tag team.**TV Championship match: Sonic (c) vs Yoshi**Sonic wins the match via a Super Spindash. The match was a great back and forth contest of egg rolls, spindashes, kicks, punches and Yoshi almost won with his Egg Lay submission. Both competitors shook hands after the fierce opener as a sign of respect. As Sonic leaves, Robin tries to challenge for a title match but is quickly disposed by Sonic. He then states that as TV Champion, he will do his best to protect the integrity of the company by not allowing it to fall into the hands of the Fire Emblem fighters or anyone that seeks to disgrace his title. **Intercontinental Championship Match: Pikachu vs Marth vs Link vs Mario(c)**Marth wins after a dancing blade on Mario. He then tries to recruit Link (a fellow heel) to join his group and help him beat up a downed Mario and Pikachu (who are both babyfaces). Link appears to accept at first but then strikes down Marth instead of Mario. Link states that he only fights for himself and no one else but he is still a heel so he also attacks Pikachu and Mario afterwards. Marth then gets up seething and tells the audience to await his Plan B. **Women's World Championship match: Dark Samus vs Zelda (c)**Zelda wins after a Phantom Attack. It was just a typical match where Zelda was the crowd favorite and Dark Samus was just a heel. No shenanigans as Zelda was able to teleport out of every potential Charged Shot or Missile attempt by Dark Samus.**Men's Tag Team Championship Match: Ganondorf and Bowser (c) vs Ike and Chrom vs Ken and Ryu**The champions retain their title after they pin Ryu. Ryu was taken out with a Doriya and Flying Slam combo. Angry that they were not involved in the finish, Chrom and Ike decide to attack Bowser and Ganondorf with steel chairs and even work together to slam Ganondorf through a table. Ken and Ryu then help out Bowser in fending off Ike and Chrom as a show of respect. Bowser then helps Ganondorf get back up and the crowd cheers.**Women's Tag Team Championship match: Lucina and Corrin vs Peach and Daisy (c)** Lucina wins after Corrin paralyzes Peach then hits Peach with a Shield Breaker. Daisy was previously taken out with a Baseball Bat by Lucina when the ref wasn't looking. Post-match beatdown occurs then Zelda comes out to make the save and takes down Corrin with Din's Fire and a Phantom Attack. Teases future Women's Championship match between Lucina and Zelda. **World Heavyweight Championship Match (2 out of 3 falls match): Joker vs Fox (c)**Fox was the first to score a pinfall after a superkick and Joker was able to get back in the game via a surprise rollup after being hit by fire charge or whatever his up b is called. Joker Wins after using Arsene to tap out Fox via Eiagon Submission. While both were babyfaces, Joker was struggling in the match so Fox was technically the heel as he was more comfortable throughout the match. Afterwards, Marth comes out to appear to attack both Joker and Fox but Joker suddenly attacks Fox from behind. Joker, Ike and Marth beat down on Fox a bit more before Joker cuts a promo. He joined forces with Marth to ensure that his title reign will remain intact and by surrounding himself with fellow champions, he is invulnerable. As he is about to finish, Banjo and Kazooie then suddenly climb up the ring to attack Marth and Joker but Joker is able to escape with his championship. Marth is then repeatedly pecked in the face by Kazooie and is then piledrived by Banjo. They finish Marth off with a huge somersault splash. Banjo then grabs the mic. and simply says that they are finally here and Joker will get what he deserves soon. The crowd cheers loudly as the show ends.**Bonus**There's a pre-show battle royale at the start of the show. Everyone that was not given a match is in the battle royale and Piranha Plant wins by throwing both Charizard and K Rool over the top rope."
Practice matches?: Where do you guys discuss playing online? I need people to spar with to get better. Went to a smash ultimate tournament locally and got beat by a cheap donkey Kong that grab and jumped off stage. He won the whole tournament doing the same thing and got me thinking I should practice more. Before the tournament I had played back in April so I was a little rusty. Any where smash ultimate players set up matches?

"Why aren’t there more frames of lag on peach’s dair?: From what the frames suggest, her dair is technically negative on shield but since there’s no lag on it you’re able to 2 frame a nair into constant shield pressure. The rest of the cast doesn’t have this problem (with aerials), creating a pretty formulaic and unfun way to play as and against. Just float into dair repeat. How would you edit this move if you were to? Add more frames of end lag? Edit the move entirely for something else? I’m interested to hear."

"Let's theory craft the Hero's tier/competitive viability: I for one cannot wait to get my hands on the Hero.  They seem to be very deep, strategic, and resource based characters with the mana management.  I think he has a high probability of being a mid to high tier, hinging on a few unknowns.  How does the special moves and command menu work?  Will mana be limited per stock or can it be regained somehow?  So far the frame data analysis shows him to be pretty average and almost on the slower side.  This may hint that he has good K.O power but will he be able to confirm combo into these moves to take stocks?  Sleep seems like an easy confirmation at high percentage but it also seems slightly slow and predictable.  Also everything we've seen so far is subject to subtle changes which can drastically change him.  What's your guys thoughts?  Haven't seen much debate on his viability so I thought I'd try to start one."

"Of all the major third parties without a fighter, I'd say Ubisoft feels like the most glaring omission: I'm not saying this as someone dying for Rayman to be a fighter or anything like that.  I just mean that given how close Nintendo and Ubisoft have been in the recent past specifically with a crossover game featuring Mario and the Rabbids.  But even beyond that, Ubisoft was probably the biggest third party dev that had faith in the Wii U when Nintendo first launched the hardware, and Rayman's trophy inside Sm4sh was definitely worth note considering as far as I recall no other third parties without a fighter had a trophy in Sm4sh.  On top of all of that, Ubisoft simply has the kinds of fighters that would fit in so well in a game like Smash.  All the same, its easy to find great fits from other third parties not yet with a fighter, Activision has Crash or Spyro (my money would be on Crash if we get one of them), Bethesda (Id) has Doom Slayer which would feel oddly fitting, and Koei Tecmo has Ryu Hayabusa.  But my point isn't about who fits best, but rather who has the kind of relationship with Nintendo that most feels like they should have a fighter before anyone else.  I'd argue that Ubisoft probably is in that spot.  Though, on the same thought process, I can't forget the Hyrule or Fire Emblem Warriors games.  Koei Tecmo definitely has a close relationship with Nintendo as well in this regard."

Now's the time to go over a few storylines heading into the weekend. * Alright, seriously, can ANYONE beat Jeremy? Alright, I'm getting tired of saying shit like this. Oh, Jeremy hasn't lost in two and a half years. Jeremy has won all five of the Jeb's House tournaments in history. Jeremy this, Jeremy that. Yeah, we get it, I don't think I need to elaborate here. He wins all the time, and at this point it feels more like a formality that he wins than anything else. The day that he gets upset will be a historic moment for the Jeb's House series, but if his Marth is on point again this Saturday, don't be surprised if we don't have to wait another six months for history to be made. &amp;#x200B;* Gerardo was just as lethal as advertised. In his first outing at Jeb's House, Gerardo proved to be the formidable force everybody expected. Going on a 5-2 tear through bracked, he was knocked into loser's bracket off of a brutal 3-0 by Matt in Winner's Semis before getting revenge on his fellow Falco main in Loser's Finals. Sporting one of the most finely tuned and polished neutral approaches in Jeb's House, Gerardo has a habit of leaving his opponents responding with confusion. His game, heavily emphasizing converting short hop laser approaches into combos, produced many a, “What the fuck that's bullshit,” “Falco laser is OP, pls nerf,” “Jesus, that must be the best Bair in the game!” and, “How did that bird?” He will be a strong contender for sure, but he will have to deal with his exact opposite, Matt, first. The untechnical Falco main has given Gerardo fits many times before, so we will see if he can figure out how not to fall for Matt's traps. &amp;#x200B;* How the hell is Matt still getting third place? The most consistent player in Jeb's House history, other than Jeremy, is Matt. In all four tournaments he has attended, he has advanced to Winner's Finals. His track record in Loser's Finals is not as good, sporting a 3-1 record. Seemingly, he finds his way to Jeremy and after losing, can't put together another win to earn the rematch in Grands. But never getting worse than 3rd at multiple tournaments is something only Jeremy and Matt have accomplished, so he is clearly still a strong contender for the throne. What is unsure, however, is how he has managed to stay consistently strong despite being fucking terrible at the game. And no, I don't mean that he just doesn't wavedash or l-cancel. I mean that he only uses, like, three moves. I mean, sure, Gerardo pretty well only approaches with short hop laser, but that's, like, a good approach option. Matt's only concept of approaching is a dash attack. The only combo he knows is f-smashing away a stock(his or someone else's) into chugging a beer into crushing said beer on his forehead. Watching him get 3rd at 4 different Jeb's House tournaments is like watching a drunk Tim Tebow make the NFL  playoffs throwing wobbly balls. Seeing him beat Gerardo is like an NBA game where the teams change goals but noone told them, so the Cavs beat the Warriors because nobody told them they weren't supposed to airball 3-pointers at their own goal all night. There's a method in the madness somehow, I suppose, but goddamn is it annoying to lose to when all you had to do was dash back and grab. You win this time, Matt, but I won't fall for it again next time. Well, I mean, what are the chances he dash attacks for the ninth time in a row, I mean really...    * How will Chris bounce back? As the most erstwhile training partners, Chris and Jeremy know each other's playstyles all too well. It's gotten to a point where if they meet in tournament, the chips will simply have to fall where they fall, and so far they have fallen in Jeremy's favor. Chris is confident though, that their familiarity with one another will give him a shot if they meet on Saturday. More importantly for Chris, though, are Matt and Gerardo. He finally took a set off Matt in Loser's Finals of Jeb's House IV, but subsequently fell in Loser's Semis to Gerardo six months later. He seems to have excised his former demon in Jimmy, who it seemed had Chris's number for some time, but now faces the two Falco mains as his greatest barrier. Complicating matters, is that they couldn't play the character any differently. Gerardo play makes sense, surgically knifing into opponents' defenses with lasers and aerials, while Matt's Falco makes as much sense as my nerdy, white, Magic playing cousin attending a Tyler Perry premiere. It's a steep hill to climb, for sure, but Chris has reportedly been focusing on his punishes and combos so as to make every hit he gets against the birds count. It also doesn't hurt that his main is ~~the best~~ ~~second best~~ ~~third best~~ ~~60-40est~~ ~~fuckpufflol~~ Fox.     * Will Zach or Josh make a splash? The two 5th place finishers at Jeb's House V are looking for a victory of the top four finishers, and with that, to contend for the Jeb's House Bowling Pin. After a journeyman's career that saw him main, at various times, Ganondorf, Captain Falcon, Yoshi, Pikachu, and other characters that will never win a major tournament, Zach seems to have settled on the more viable Marth as his main, though he still brings out the Yoshi from time to time for laughs. He has developed an effective style distinct from Jeremy's: while Jeremy has an effective combo game against spacies, Zach seems to have the upper hand against floaties. His growing skill against them has even manifested in taking sets off Jeremy in the ditto at times. If he can polish up his punishes against Fox and Falco(and practice your goddamn chaingrabs like I told you to, goddamnit), he may have a great shot at making a deep run on Saturday. In a similar vein, Josh is holding steady as the only real Peach main in Jeb's House. He took Gerardo to two game 5 sets at Jeb's House V, and although he lost both of those sets, they came down to the final stock each time. Effective turnips, not letting his opponent land, and strong one-hit punishes off reads with moves like down smash, fair, and dash attack are his hallmarks, and he has shown a promising ability to take sets off Jeremy in friendlies. Perhaps a little luck, perhaps a little work and polish on his game, and he could be in contention for a run at Grand Finals. That is, of course, if he hasn't been learning how to wobble this whole time just to make us play Ultimate instead.    * How will some former 2nd place finishers fare? After locking up 2nd place at Jeb's House I and taking the only set from Jeremy anyone ever has, Jimmy has seen a marked slip in placements. It remains to be seen if he has anything up his sleeve, if he can bounce back to his glory days of perennial top 4 finishes. What he has definitely done, however, is correct a little legal issue. Apparently when he was born, the nurse wrote down Kyle instead of Jimmy, and after all these years, he finally got around to correcting the mistake. When we asked him about it he said, “No you fucking idiots, I changed it to Jimmy so you would start calling me that shit. It really hurts that you guys just don't listen to me when I say I hate that name and please call me Kyle, and I was hoping maybe you would stop if it wasn't a joke anymore.” Classic Jimmy! Will, on the other hand, is making his return to the Jeb's House series after missing Jeb's House V. Also known as, “The only fucking reason I have to bother making character icons for characters on the far side of Captain Falcon,” Will mains Link, Zelda, and probably some other shitty characters, I don't know, he plays like all of them. Despite playing low tiers, he has managed to snag a pair of top 4 finishes in his 2 appearances at Jeb's House, even getting to challenge Jeremy in Grand Finals at Jeb's House III. He is similar to Matt, in that they don't have much in the way of tech skill, but are masters of reads and intuition. Unlike Matt, however, he has deluded himself into believing the characters he plays are actually good, instead of just being good. Common arguments seem to revolve around the fact that you can aim Din's Fire, Zelda has, like, a LOOOONG Up B, and Link has 2, count em, 2! hits on his forward smash! How can they be bad characters? But who am I to say, he's the one who gets top half placements at Jeb's House with low tiers. I cant argue with results. So, uh, anyway, if you're interested in watching Melee this Saturday sometime around 3 PM Central time, and think to yourself, ya know what? Those guys at CEO are TOO good. I'd rather watch some baddies bang on their controllers like bongos desperately trying to ledgedash. Then tune into twitch.tv/jebshouse, Saturday, June 29th, 3 PM Central."

"Why Joker is inherently frustrating to play against: The purpose of this is NOT to say that Joker is overpowered or in need of straight nerfs. The purpose of this is to say that Joker is *unfun to play against*, and is in need of reworks. At the moment, many (including myself) think that Joker is annoying to deal with and much more difficult to play around than every other fighter in the game. Here will be listed my reasoning for this claim, as well as proposed changes to make Joker less overpowered.When playing Joker, you are able to charge Arsene in two ways: through getting hit in normal gameplay (slower) or through getting hit while your down special (faster). I’ll start by talking about the first of these. When Joker receives damage from another player in any way, Arsene’s meter will receive charge.This mechanic has two massive flaws. First of all, it punishes the opponent for fulfilling the main objective of the game: attacking the other player. Since it is not viable to avoid attacking your opponent, there is simply no counterplay to this mechanic. Although they could be considered inherently unfun, revenge mechanics such as Arsene aren’t necessarily frustrating in and of themselves. Due to the similarities between Limit and Arsene, I will be comparing Joker to Cloud a considerable amount. In Ultimate (not Sm4sh), I find Limit to be a perfectly reasonable mechanic for a few reasons. The first major difference is that the Limit meter empties after using a single special attack, which reduces spam and introduces counterplay. Essentially, Cloud only gets one powered up special move while under the effects of Limit, while Joker gets as many as he can throw out while under the effects of Arsene. Also, since Cloud’s up special cancels his limit when used, one of the best counterplays I’ve found to Limit is knocking Cloud off the stage, forcing him to use a special to recover and wasting Limit early. With Joker however, no such option exists, meaning that the opponent has to survive until Arsene wears off. The second major difference is regarding the moves that Limit and Arsene replace. Limit replaces Cloud’s down special with Finisher, which is a high risk high reward move that can potentially kill the opponent early. The downsides to this move are one, it’s rather hard to hit; two, it only does 1% of damage if it doesn’t kill; and three, it uses your limit meter when used. Arsene replaces three of Joker’s moves though: Eiha is replaced with Eigaon, which is essentially Elfire with unlimited uses (and we all know how fun Elfire and PK Fire are to play against); Grappling Hook is replaced with Wings of Rebellion, which is a much more reliable and effective recovery move that makes Joker invincible while using it; and Rebel’s Guard is replaced with Tetrakarn, a move that is both a reflector and a counter. If any of these moves could only be used one time, they wouldn’t be of concern, however the spamability of these moves (while not necessarily overpowered) is universally frustrating to play against. The last of these moves, Tetrakarn, is perhaps the most egregious, as it effectively makes the user invincible to everything but grabbing. While this itself is not hard to play around, the fact that Joker can constantly spam the move is. The third major difference between Cloud and Joker is the way their revenge is charged. Although both use their down special to charge their respective mechanic, Joker has a major advantage. Cloud is completely vulnerable to attack when charging Limit, and therefore has to choose when to charge somewhat carefully. Joker gains unbreakable super armor on his down special though, and even gains Arsene charge faster when attacked. Due to this, the only risk with Rebel’s Guard is getting grabbed, but due to its incredibly fast startup and end lag a fast Joker player can easily cancel and dodge if they see a grab coming, since grabs are typically slower than a move such as a jab or dash attack.The second problem with Arsene, and the reason that makes this mechanic so frustrating, is that Arsene charges much too fast. It only takes around 50% damage to fully charge and activate Arsene without the use of Rebel’s Guard, meaning Joker will have his Persona active twice or more in a single life in most circumstances. Due to the increased damage and knockback Arsene provides, as well as the inability to make Arsene prematurely go away, Joker players are rewarded much too heavily for taking damage. In fact, it is not exactly difficult for a decent Joker player to rack up more damage on the opponent while Arsene is active than the opponent was able to output when Arsene wasn’t. Essentially, Arsene gives Joker a much easier way to turn the tables without much skill involved and without counterplay available.The thing that ties all of this together is Joker’s great moves and frame data. If Joker himself was only mediocre (take Lucario for instance), Arsene would not be as much of a problem as it currently is. However, this is not the case, as Joker by himself is very powerful and Arsene is simply the icing on the cake.Ignoring the possibility of an entire resign of the character, my proposed changes to Joker are fairly straightforward. First, make Joker’s down special wear off after a certain amount of time, similar to a counter, OR make the armor on Joker’s down special breakable. This would make Rebel’s Guard require a bit more strategy as to when to use it. Second, make Arsene charge a fair bit slower (perhaps ~50% to ~75% required damage to charge). This would reduce the impact on the game that Arsene provides. Third, make specials take off a chunk of the meter when used, similar to Robin’s tomes. This would make Joker much less annoying to deal with when Arsene is active, as well as dampening the amount of spam that Joker can throw out. Please note that I am suggesting that ANY of these changes be implemented, not ALL of them.Overall, in his current state, Joker is a fundamentally unfun character whose poor design makes him frustrating to play against. Once again, I am not making the claim that Joker is overpowered, just annoying to deal with. In fact, many players I have talked to in multiple different circles agree that Joker is one of the most frustrating fighters to battle. If the proposed changes are followed, Joker’s revenge mechanic would become much more bearable than it currently is. ------- Disclaimers: 1) I am not exactly a top tier player, so my argumentation is based on local matches with friends, online matches, and a few local tournaments. I understand that the meta for much higher tier players is different, but at the end of the day the majority of players are mostly casual, and this was written with that fact in mind.2) Please consider these arguments from an objective standpoint, as much thought and consideration has been put into them; this is not just the ranting of a salty player. 3) I am completely open to feedback and willing to change my mind on the statements I have made if they are factually incorrect or if someone is able to provide a solid argument stating otherwise.Thanks for reading, and let me know your thoughts!"

Or do you dislike playing any characters from games that you love?: I'm a big fan of Mega Man and Sonic games, but I'm not really too fond of playing as either of them in Smash. I've really tried, but I just can't get the hang of either of them.  On the other hand, I hate the NES Ice Climber game, but Ice Climbers are some of my favorite characters to play."
"Why Smash Ultimate lacks storylines?: Mang0 said that in a video/livestream and i am surprised i never noted that, besides that salem vs maister money match and wizzrobe pontentionally winning a Melee and Ultimate major at once, ultimate almost don't have anything to looks forawrds to, and while storylines are not that important, it can make the watch experience kinda boring.

"Anyone else find some of the sound effects frustrating and annoying?: Now this may sound like a fairly negative post and all but I just intend as a question. I love the smash brothers games and have been playing them for a long long time. However there is one thing that has always bothered me, and that’s some of the repetitive sound effects and short lines of dialogue that certain characters say during attacks. The characters that come to mind instantly are Ness and Lucas with their “PK FIRE” “PK FREEZE” and things along those lines. Another one is Captain Falcon with his “Falcon pauunchhh!” When people use these characters, you’ll hear those lines like 20+ times and for some reason, I just can’t stand it. To be fair, this frustration with some of the repetitive sounds isn’t exclusive to Smash either, so again I’m not hating or blaming the game for anything. Another example is Overwatch and how some of those characters say the same line of dialogue every time they do a certain attack. I just wanted to see if other people feel the same way or if I’m just going insane lol."
Decided to make a Lucas montage. Enjoy!:

"Found a neat bug regarding Shulk's backlash if used in a windzone: So I was messing around in stage builder with windzones (literally all I do with stage builder. Messing with momentum and seeing how different moves react is pretty fun) and I found out that if you hit something with Shulk's backslash, Shulk will be pushed by the windbox for the duration of the hitstun. So, if you hit something with Backslash, during that little hit-freeze, shulk will be pushed upwards by an up-draft, sideways by wind pushing to the left or right, and so on. Not super cool or usefull, but it's pretty cool either way. Here's a link to the screenshot I took so you can check it out:    [https://twitter.com/iOusify/status/1144107573995421696](https://twitter.com/iOusify/status/1144107573995421696)   Ps: I also found another cool glitch with Kirby with a maximum speed windzone going downwards. If you use down b just as you jump, Kirby will transform, but the activation glowy-swirly effects will repeat over and over and you won't be able to move or cancel it. There's no way to get out of this to my knowledge. Lemme know if you find something."

"Our House is on Fire: Earlier this week, Etika killed himself. He was an incredibly popular and beloved content creator in the Smash Community. In April, the player at the top of the MPGR had a dead crab thrown at him by an unruly member of a crowd. In August, the entire Smash community was rocked when, on the EVO Grand Finals stage, the Smash 4 players stalled a match in answer from booing from the crowd.And, there is another detail, further afield but still impossible not to include in the conversation. In April of last year, a competitor in a Madden tournament in Jacksonville opened fire on his fellow players, killing 2 and wounding 10.Guys, there is no other way to say this. **Our House is on Fire.**Some may call this alarmist. That is true in a literal sense. We need to ring an alarm.For way too long, the community's atmosphere has been taking on a tone that is frankly disturbing. This includes the bullying of players and notable commentators, due to a number of factors ranging from opinions to personal matters. A general feeling of open hostility towards some players has become easily visible. Character specific hatred being targeted towards players of that character is depressingly common. As is a ""Cancel"" culture that shames and ridicules players and commentators who have made a notable mis-step but are not deserving of an internet harassment campaign.But, mental health problems would be common anyway. Competition is stressful and E-sports seems more likely to draw in a crowd who already have anxiety relative to regular sports. Players compete for numerical ranking placements that determine sponsorship deals. They often have to be streamers to make ends meet.People might say that it is the fault of pre-existing mental illness that people harm themselves or others. That is mostly true. But, the Smash Competitive and Online Media community has very many people who might be susceptible to such things. We can never know how anyone will take it and how much they can take. This is on our shoulders.I don’t know how to say this any clearer. If the current makeup and communication styles of the community do not change, Etika will not be the last tragedy. I am shocked that more intense mental health incidents have not already occurred. I can only imagine the number of top Bayonetta players during Smash 4 who had moments of Suicidal Idealization.I’d love to say what that needs to happen here is that folks just need to be good to one another.  But, let’s face it. People have been saying that for a long time. It’s only getting worse.We cannot help but look to the actual economics and technology of the way the community is organized. Different communication technologies and economic trends make different communities.Twitch chat, with its fast moving text scrolls, is a nightmare to moderate and a breeding ground of harmful behaviours. Twitter is a medium that often rewards sassy or sarcastic comments, producing a feedback loop in favor of some of the worst behaviors. Reddits are large and often impossible to police.But, consider the sponsorship dilemma as well. It is not enough to be a good player to make money. You have to stream, tweet, and interact on social media. The largest income source for players has become the path to being influencers. Income is clout. But, clout is exposure to harassment.I don’t really know how to fix this. I don’t. Anyone who is promising an easy problem to a culture problem is lying or misguided.Tangible problems with demonstrable harm caused need tangible solutions. I propose the following.1. Tournament streaming organizations should adopt slowmode or other means of controlling twitch chat on their streams. I’m talking folks like VGBC, 2GG, and House of 3000. Unrestricted Twitch Chat is a cesspool and it is pooling out from everywhere.2. The moderator team for this reddit and others are not asleep at the wheel. Efforts like locking down posts during the Salem saga demonstrates a real effort to keep the situation in line. But, more moderators and stricter moderation of player/streamer negative content should be enforced where possible. It is a crap solution, but it might help stop certain trends from gaining momentum.3. More attention must be shined on the matter. I would love to see E-Sports Teams, Tournament Organizers, and Streaming Companies publicly partner with E-Sports Mental Health Organizations and promote them pro-bono on stream. Ditto for key youtubers doing the same on their channels.4. If there are already organizations in place that give either players or content creators advice, resources, or financial support for mental health then these need to be supported and boosted. If not they should be made. I would love to hear that someone had made the “Etika Memorial Mental Health Network”. If there is a top player/community member who reads this, then having important names attached to it would be incredibly valuable. But, the reality is this. Players, Commentators, Youtubers, and other Community Figures need easy access and funds for mental health resources.5. Other discussions of tangible impactful steps to make a dent in the problem. Etika died last week. The time for unspecific ideas is past. The time for real, tangible steps, that can be accomplished reasonably is now. Even modest solutions with small impact are welcome.Mental Health in Gaming is a serious problem. Mental Health in the broader Smash Bros Community (Melee and Ultimate) is a problem. Folks like Zero and Leffen have been talking about it for months/years. We need to listen."

However, she was too low to make it back on stage so she slowly drifted into the blastzone. Once she died, something weird happened to my character where he was locked in hitstun animation as if he was continuously getting hit upwards by an invisible Daisy umbrella. Once this stopped, Daisy respawned with no pants...Even more oddly, when Daisy was in hitstun she got her skirt back and looked normal, and then in certain animations she would be wearing a small pink skirt over these black shorts you see in the screenshot.

"What if Cloud's Limit bar showed him how much time he has left before Limit goes away, similar to Joker's Rebel Gauge and Arsene?: I dunno, if Joker can see how much time he has left before Arsene disappears or Shulk with his Monado Arts, then I feel like Cloud could also get this visual change."
"Dr.Mario: Is down-tilt fair a thing? I have pulled it off a lot before, but I'ｍ pretty sure it can be DId out of, plus Tornado just seems to kill at lower percentages more reliably. Should I stop using this ”combo”？Because I really like killing with fair, but nobody seems to notice the potential in the fist."
"I recently interviewed Axe about his Summit win and about why he plays Pikachu. His incredible kindness and humble attitude are infectious, and nice to read right now.: "
Any story lines in ultimate?: Haven’t really been paying attention to the game competitively. I know mkleo is winning with joker and that’s about it.
Any idea if we’re getting a breakdown video for the Hero?: Title basically. Ever since his announcement I’ve been really confused on how switching between spells for each special is going to work. I would love a breakdown video before he’s released I’m just wondering if anyone knows if they’re planning one.
"alright r/smashbros! tell me who is the worst character in SSBU?: Lets figure this out, once and for all."
"New to the Smash Community: Hey guys, where should I start? I’m just a casual player, but enjoy watching elite talent play. The problem is I don’t understand much of the lingo or anything. Is there a website or video to explain?"

Mang0 brings his CS skills to Melee: 
Pokémon Trainer’s most under utilized tool: The Zard: Aside from the god tier Zard walk and him being the heaviest and therefore making the stock stretch just a bit further; what other strengths does Charizard have to make him worth using in rotation with the other two Pokémon?
"Going To My 1st Tourney Tonight and I Need Some Help: Like the titles says I’m going to my first tournament, Ultimate Shockwave 29, but I have no clue how choosing stages works. Help please."
"Has there ever been a character you wanted to play, but you just lost interest when he or she became overused?: To me, this has happened with Palutena. I was really looking forward to using her pre-release because she was one of my favorite characters in Kid Icarus: Uprising, one of my favorite games. Now just look at the Orion Stats rankings of the Top 100 players and their characters will show you how many people play Palutena. It's like she's everywhere. And we got so many Palutenas here in Tristate. It's gotten to the point where I mostly don't care about her anymore and I don't want to even consider playing her competitively. Now this has happened with Lucina and Wolf as well, but with Palutena it just hurts me the most because of how much I had a connection to her compared to those two. Have you ever felt the same way?Maybe I'm just overly butthurt that I can't be considered special though. Feel free to call me out if you think I am."
"ProjectNX successfully modded Shield Stops, Shield Drops, Slide Offs, Jump Cancels and DACUS into Ultimate!: https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstruseTangibleKangarooWow"
"Wording in Grant Kirkhope's interview with Shesez may imply we ar egetting more than 1 Banjo remix?: https://youtu.be/EnTdb5wgV2g?t=338One of the feedback Grant received for Spiral Mountain was the 2nd half should be as crazy as he wants it to be, but he should only stick to Spiral Mountain and not include other tunes because of other remixers working on other stuff."

"Nintendolife Feature: Meet Axe, The Smash Bros. Underdog Who Changed The Competitive Scene Overnight: "
Smash character usage statistics?: Is there any stat tracking site out there in the vein of stuff like Dotabuff or Street Fighter V's official website where you can see a list of characters from most played to least played and their winrate? I'm a big fan at looking at this sort of stuff in competitive roster-based games
"PP talks about floaties: ""Puff is fun but twitch got too mad"" &lt;/3: "
"Any GameCube controllers in new condition that are near identical to the Smash Ultimate one from Nintendo?: I'm looking to buy a gamecube adapter and need to find new gamecube controller that is almost authentic to the original. The one I've been looking at is Nintendo's Smash Ultimate gamecube controller, but they're now selling for $80 when they were originally $30 when they first came out. Is there a controller that is wired that is close in replicating the look and feel of the original gamecube controller besides the $80 one from Nintendo? Links/Brand names would be nice!"
"PSA: Use Pac-Man's bonus fruit against him for the love of god: Seriously, even in professional tournaments I constantly see players just throwing the galaxian into the ground for some reason. Even just holding onto the fruit completely deprives pac of one of his most important tools, and that's not even touching on the insane combos you could theoretically pull of with something other than pac's boring-ass a moveset."
"Removing For Glory is honestly one of the worst things they did with Ultimate, if not THE worst: I know this has been complained about before, but I want to get everything off my chest and explain in depth on just how much this still affects me even 6 months after the game's release.In For Glory, I knew exactly what I was getting into. When I wanted to play 1v1, I did just that. And when i wanted to play Teams, no problem. For Glory got me covered and gave me exactly what I wanted. Really, the ONLY problems I had with For Glory was that 1v1 was 2 stock and not 3, and Teams were Time instead of Stock. Literally all they had to do was change these, but lo and behold...We got Quickplay now instead, words cannot describe how much I hate this mode. Now I actually have to worry about getting in matches that I don't want to play, 1v1 works most of the time, sure, but it's still not guaranteed as I still sometimes get matched up with players using a completely different rules than I do (items enabled, final smash or 1 stock 2 minutes, etc.) and that's a huge problem and completely unacceptable. I can NEVER find Team matches in Quickplay, ever. Whenever I set my preferred rules to Teams, I ALWAYS get toxic FFA's with items or final smashes, and we're playing on stages like Hanenbow. It's because of these reasons I stay away from Quickplay completely, the preferred rules system just doesn't work and I do not enjoy that mode at all. But then there's the Battle Arenas, which is definitely a better alternative to Quickplay. But man, they are nowhere near a good replacement for For Glory either. Because if I join someone else's Arena, I have to deal with potentially playing someone who can't handle losing and will ban me just for beating them. This has happened A LOT, and because of this I'm very weary about joining other's Arenas. This isn't a problem when I host my own Arena, but the problem now is that, if I want to play Teams, I have to wait 15-20 minutes or more for 3 other players to find my Arena and join. It can be an extreme chore just to find a good Teams match, something For Glory did for me so damn easily with no issues.Because of all these reasons, Ultimate's online feels like such a step back from Smash 4's. It's really a shame because I love Ultimate, gameplay wise it's my favorite Smash. But it's online is seriously a souring experience compared to Smash 4 and that really bums me out. I can only hope in a future patch we get a new mode for online that's a lot closer to what For Glory was like."
"Hello everyone, I came up with an idea, would you like it if, I made this story I came up with and made it a Comic?: So here is how it starts, A huge tournament is about to begin, with the first batch of fights, (I might not keep these the same) it's Fox VS Wario, Pikachu VS Pichu, Samus VS Sonic, Captain Falcon VS Donkey Kong, Wolf VS Marth, Bowser VS Jigglypuff, Ness VS Inkling 1, Kirby VS Meta Knight, Mario VS Charizard, Inkling 2 VS Squirtle, and Pit VS Dark Pit. As the tournament nears it's end someone (remember those enimies from SSE, that have grey clothes, those things.) has learned about the horrific Master Hand, and is using all the energy gathered from all these fights to summon Master Hand in hopes of it being loyal to him (for lack of a better term, lol im cringy.) Once he is summoned (after the semifinals or quaterfinals) The thingy from SSE (forgot the name) says ""I have summoned you, so therefore YOU obey ME!"" Master Hand is like ""Obey me??? Thats my line. *then he does his laser beam thingy and kills the (I forgot the name, lol)* While he is being summoned Zelda sense his immense power, uhh, idk because I can't think of anything, she will just be important later, plz give ideas. And then Master Hand starts attacking people at the Tournament, but some, not all, but some contenders, like Cpt Falcon, Sonic, Mario, Fox, Falco, Samus, Inklings, Marth, Pikachu, Ness, Kirby, Meta Knight, Pit, etc try to stop Master Hand, but they are defeated, and they are forced to retreat with Ness blinding Master Hand with PK Flash to buy them some time (Yes, I know Master Hand doesn't have eyes, but I gotta find someway to make this work) Meta Knight then suggests the idea that the they find the legendary Mr Game &amp; Watch (or Pac-Man if you guys want him instead) who were viewers of the tournament, meanwhile, Zelda awakens Link knowing they will need all the help they can get, Link trains a bit, then Zelda tells him where to go to find the others (Ya, know so they can team up to try and defeat Master Hand) Link then meets up with them, he joins them, and then Mr Game &amp; Watch or Pac-Man (if you want him instead) trains them for [x] amount of time, meanwhile Master Hand has been cause destruction or whatever, and then they confront him, and the battle begins! To be countinued lol, if you wanna see the ending, I gotta make the comic. Please give critcism, and ideas on how to improve. I will make this if you guys want it."

"Who should be buffed in the next update and what do you want to see buffed?: For me, it's Cloud he's easy to two frame, has an awful recovery, and has a hard time killingAccording to me, the ways to buff Cloud would be\-Make it easier to get limit to make it easier to kill\-Or just give his limit infinite time because it's fucking annoying when people can just camp out limit also it kinda solves the problem of him not being able to kill\-Revert Nair because I miss it and plus I actually want to hit people with it normally or out of shield also why was it nerfed anyway?\-Buff Up air because I feel like directional air dodges were already a nerf to itSo yea who do you guys think should be buffed?"

A literal taunt to body: 
"Is Smash Ultimate worth the purchase in South Africa for online play?: Latency has always been an issue in most games in South Africa with the closest servers being in Europe. Since Ultimate uses Peer-to-Peer, is ping a problem? Are there enough active players in the country to find decent matches? Obviously hoping for this to be answered by South African players, but can anyone in other generally high latency countries share their experiences?"
"Malos (shulk echo fighter) movest idea: Stage entrance: dark purple particles form around malo's  starting spot on the stage and then malos will appear out of them, similar to his teleporting animation in xenoblade chronicles 2.All tilts, smash attacks and aerials would be the same as shulks but the sweet and sourspot of shulks sword wont be on malos sword and malos will have even damage across his entire sword.Neutral B arts:• monado armor: gives you and any players on your team an octagonal shield of armor that absorbs 3 hits for 0% before breaking, the movement speed reduction, launch power reduction, jump reduction and damage reduction effects would be significantly stronger than shulks monado shield and the art also has a longer recharge time than shulks monado shield.•monado eater: hitting an enemy gives them an effect similar to eigha dealing 1.5% for 12 seconds, monado eater also slightly decreases gauges over time like such as clouds limit  gauge and jokers rebellion gauge, monado eater goes on recharge after you've hit someone while the art is active.•monado jail: when activated disables all enemy specials if they're on stage or anywhere that isn't off stage out past the left and right ledge for 7.5seconds, monado jail also can't affect you if you have invincibility frames active or are respawning, monado eater has a 30second cooldown.•monado speed: same as shulks monado speed.•monado smash: same as shulks monado smash.Side B, striker edge: attacks an a wide upwards arc in front of himself  for 12% that has deals 2x damage if it hits an enemy from the back.Up B, monado cyclone: when used on stage malos summons a purple tornado that is basically a bigger version of clouds finishing touch that deals 16.6% and can reflect projectiles that hit it, if used offstage the cyclone will send malos upwards while it remains in the place it was used for a short amount of time.Down B, counter: is the same as shulks vision counter but animated differently"
"Is it possible for someone else's data to be accidentally transferred to your game?: Yesterday I turned on smash on my 3Ds, which was supposed to have no data. Instead, I found hundreds of trophies, challenges nearly all complete, and even a couple custom characters under the name Becky. I did, however, borrow a Fire Emblem game from the library, which is what I was playing before smash bros. Is it possible that my 3Ds thinks I am someone who has played the borrowed game and transferred that person's data onto my smash game?"

Fatality's Captain Falcon Edgegaurd Guide: 
"[Shower Thought] World of Light's mission structure could be construed as a child playing with his toys: Master hand as the creator of the Smash universe has always felt to me like a child with action figures as the fighters, as seen in the opening cinematic for  Smash 64. World of Light missions often have you collecting spirits by fighting in missions that will tweak certain criteria of the fight to emulate the spirit you're collecting while still using existing characters and items. I feel like this could be seen as a kid using his imagination and his toys to act out fantasy. Originally I thought the mission design in this game was lazy (and while I still think many of the missions are too gimmicky) viewing them in this light made them feel more charming to me."

Here's something for the Kirby mains to look forward too for when banjo joins smash...: 
Revised mid-high level tier list because the first one was bad: 
"Thoughts on purchasable palette swaps: Lately I noticed a lot of people suggesting or bringing up the idea of alternate costumes that u could buy. Even top players and streamers have brought it up at some point, and I don't see why it shouldn't be implemented.Obviously, it is not something mandatory that MUST be in the game, but I think it would still be a neat addition that doesn't take monumental amounts of effort like developing a fighter.This probably stems from the fact that some characters have pretty bad or uninspired palette swaps, like Charizard or Cloud.For example, Cloud's costumes would be based on Tifa, Barrett, Aerith, etc. But I also think that something you buy should have a bit more detail, like a small add-on or a render change.An example of how they could make this work out is probably make it 2 or 3 costumes per character, and release them in waves.What do you think of this idea? Would it be pointless or cool? What price would you have it be? What character do you think deserves it more?I'd love to see your opinions."

"General gc controller layout for beginners guide.: Hi, I get asked a lot by my friends that are beginning and want to take smash more seriously which is the recommended controller layout to get better.The controller layout can change depending on every character and how you feel comfortable the most, but telling this to a beginner doesnt help that much because you just leave them without a conclusion.&amp;#x200B;So this is the layout I recommend for beginners and why I assigned that command to that button. Leave the rest as default.&amp;#x200B;L - Jump, This allows you to be able to jump and still have your right thumb free. This combined with C-tilt allows you to do some basic advanced techniques such as RAR and IRAR, you can look this up in this subreddit.X - Jump, Even if you have jump in L, you also need to have jump in X because when X is pressed at the same time with A it allows you to do a short hop aerial.Y - Grab, you can grab with Z and with R+A but also having Y with grab is convenient in some cases because Z is physically a really bad button that tends to be inconsistent in old controllers. Also pressing X+Y will allow you to short hop and do the grab attack with some characters like Samus, Lucas, Yink, etc. &amp;#x200B;Advanced options:1.- Turn rumble off, the feedback of rumble isnt important in this game. It is fun but this layout is for getting a bit more serious and does more harm than good since it can be distracting. 2.- Set sensivity to max, faster inputs = better.3.- Set C stick to tilt. This is one of the most important changes, specially for beginners who spam smash attacks with the C-stick. Changing for tilts not only allows you to start playing faster, but will also allow you to transition into more advanced techniques quicker.4.- Turn up tap jump off. Do it. Please. Like for real.  Like I said before, the layout can be changed according to the character and personal preference but since beginners usually dont have a main this layout is a good starting point specially for the way you jump and tilt."

"So How, Exactly, Will the Rest of the Fighters Come Out in Time?: [Chart/Visualization(?) of the current DLC Release Lineup](https://imgur.com/9wsyAvF)&amp;#x200B;Looking at the linked release schedule, I'm a bit perplexed by how they're planning on fitting two characters in the space of (not even) one fighter. No matter what, they're going to have a *tight* schedule. That's a little bit worrisome, right? Maybe that's exciting, as it may hint to Banjo coming sooner than expected. I'm not quite sure. Any thoughts?&amp;#x200B;A few notes to get out of the way. I'm not trying to make any points about how long it takes to create a fighter, as I have no idea how Sakurai's team works specifically, I'm just talking about release windows, that's what the nice colored text refers to. Secondly, the start of February 2020 is totally the final deadline for Fighter #5, imho, but ""All fighters will be released ***by*** February 2020"" is vague enough for me to put an extra month on the chart just in case. Oh, and no, they probably won't release a surprise fighter in-between Hero and Banjo, as they've already numbered them 72 &amp; 73 on [the website](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/fighter/index.html). Finally, in case you calendar nerds spot some of the weirdness in my chart, that's because I counted the 'weeks' by the Friday Ultimate was released on, not by the traditional Sunday or Monday."
"Why do some people hate having more characters in smash?: I sometimes see people complain that Ultimate has too many characters and I can understand that people may just want a few characters but I feel like having a lot of characters keeps the tournaments interesting. I remember seeing someone who just wanted every character cut besides the top tier characters and I thought that was insane. Who wants a fighting game with like 5-7 characters? Sure you can end up perfecting their moves to a tee but I would think it would be so incredibly boring if everyone would just play 3 characters. I do hear the arguments that for melee tournaments which are usually full of Fox, Marth, Peach etc that the having only 5 or so characters makes for really intriguing matches but I think having Ultimate’s massive roster just makes the tournaments more interesting. Like instead of like 15 Foxes, you might have Fox vs K Rool one match and Fox vs Joker in another. I feel like it makes the rounds way more interesting as people have to change their game up for each character."

It seems they just attached a bunch of them to each other to make these platforms.

That MU spread is still better than most low tiers in Smash 4, so he's still somewhat usable, assuming it's correct (it's possible it's too optimistic, I suppose). The most notable placement is, in my opinion, Palutena in Even. Do you agree with him on that?

When I play quick play it seems to be usually lagless matches. I have the occasional laggy match here and there when they host (you can tell this by the ruleset) but whenever I host or join a public lobby its way more laggy than it isn’t. I’ve checked recent players and they are all in my region as well. Is this a bug?

"Top 100 Smash Players of All Time: An Update: That February 25th release date has been long passed, haha. I just wanted to give an update on how things are going.The answer is... pretty good! As some of you may know, the original plan was to complete the Top 100 by the end of February, and that didn't happen. I apologise to everyone that was counting on me and waiting for the list each time. I really should've planned better. School and mental health issues really got in the way. However, I wanted to give an update on how things will go for this account for the rest of the year.Here's the bad news... The Top 100 of all Time isn't yet ready. I want to revise the list for probably my 5th time, make my Smash 64 results better with the consultation of some S64 historians, and, most importantly, I need to finish the paragraphs for the players. I currently have 40 out of the 100 finished, and a few of those I won't even use for the 2019 version. Which brings me to the bad news: the Top 100 won't resume until November. It'll restart, meaning I'll start with 100-91 again, and it will include 2019 results for all games (excluding Smash 4 and Brawl oc). I'll probably do weekly posts on Tuesday afternoons with probably 12 posts, meaning 8 segments with 10 players, and 20-16, 15-11, 10-6, and 5-1 being separate. However, for the good news.So I don't keep everyone waiting, and I can show off my cool work, between now and November, I will slowly release my ranking for Brawl from 2009-2014 to first give some insight on how I ranked players so people aren't confused if it's the first time they've heard of Kakera, lain, or other exclusively Brawl players that will make the Top 100. They will release every other Tuesday, starting with 2009 at July 9th, stylized in the RetroSSBM format with short paragraphs on each Top 10 player's years, and a couple sentences on my choices of honorable mentions. Lastly, thank you everyone for your patience and support, especially from the Melee Stats Discord. Shoutouts to u/Pikachu492 for giving me little bits of motivation and help along the way. Until July 9th then? Here's the full schedule for the RetroSSBB Rank.2009: July 9th2010: July 23rd2011: August 6th2012: August 20th2013: September 3rd2014: September 17thTop 100 (100-91): November 7th is the tentative release date, but it will probably be the Tuesday after Ultimate's biggest major so I can see where players like Samsora, MVD, or Gluttony who will be in the 100 - 81 range are going to be ranked for Ultimate's 2019. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via discord DMs. (Orange#2008). See you in two weeks then!"

A Falcon 3.1.0 Combo Montage~: 
"The Elite/VIP Smash Problem with Online Quickplay: In smash online, as many of you know, you can reach a high enough GSP to get into what is known as Elite or VIP smash, once you reach this GSP you will mostly play against other players in Elite smash, making it a ""Great"" way to practice. There are multiple problems with elite smash in ultimate that I think need to be fixed, I will touch on a few of them quickly!  1 - The fact that almost anyone can get into elite smash just based off of luck and sometimes a ruleset can carry characters into elite smash  2 - Once in elite smash you aren't actually going to be facing only others in Elite Smash, you could face people anywhere sometimes even in the lower 4 millions  3 - You can lose Elite Smash instantly after a loss  But I feel like there is 1 major problem that comes with the tag of elite smash, and that is the fact that some people will get there characters into elite smash, and not want to play there characters anymore because they are afraid of the people in elite smash and do not want to lose there elite smash, keeping there characters at those lower elite smash gsps. Some people will go further, but many might just feel like stopping is the correct option.  How do I feel like elite smash could be improved  \-Instead of just Elite Smash, the entire system could be taken out with something alike to the Overwatch ranking system, where you only play against people that are in your ""Rank""  \-Giving people 1 mercy loss, as in you have 1 chance after a loss to get a win before you drop a rank, or drop out of elite smash  \-Enforcing a ruleset onto players in a competitive side mode, this mode would have GSP, while there was a casual side mode for those who don't feel like being ranked on there skill and want to use items, not completely alike to for fun and for glory though because the casual mode would allow players to do preferred rulesets instead of enforcing a ""For Fun"" ruleset, you would be ranked without it showing on this mode, but only for the fact that some people would use this as training and would want to use comp rules on it so they would be ranked higher.  I do understand that GSP doesn't matter. Honestly I could care less about it, but the title that comes with elite smash is nice to have and is kind of a mental challenge to make it so I don't want to keep it.   (This is a sidenote area of just problems I have with GSP in general, not just Elite Smash)  I also believe characters should rise faster the farther they are away from *Starting GSP* which is where a character is before you play them (You can tell if a character is at starting GSP if the numbers on the GSP are blue). I played many characters in my starting week getting them down to around 100k in 1 match (Starting weeks, so GSP was low anyways) and they only rose about 600k in total in 5 months before I played them, and at that time my starting GSP was 4.5 million. So I do not understand why these characters wouldn't rise slightly faster adjusting to that of the starting GSP.  Sorry for the long post, just needed to rant!"

WDBTHtGP - The Truth About Mii Brawler: 
"The 4 Types Of Smashers: Hello. I've been smashing since 64, but only competitively since Brawl. I'd like to share some content that I learned from another smasher. The original website(www.bfc.com) this was posted to was taken down. I was pure trash(compared to how I play now) until I took this information to heart. I am only sharing this information so you can improve your skill set as well. It doesn't matter if you smash to win, 4 fun, or prove a point to yourself. This will definitely help you know yourself better as a player and see things you hadn't considered before. I'll try my very best to phrase it as he/she did. Anyway....&amp;#x200B;There are 4 types of smashers you will come across when you play. Nobody is in just one box completely.1. Evader2. Blocker3. Attacker4. Adapter&amp;#x200B;Now, before I get into the differences for each you must admit to yourself that you have habits. Everyone has habits. Maybe you always pivot grab after a missed tilt. Or maybe you always spot dodge before a smash attack. If you really look back and think or look at replay data we all have habits. The four types is based on habits and mindsets we have become comfortable playing in. If you know anything about ""conditioning"" in-game then you must accept that in a way we all condition ourselves to prefer a particular play style before the game even starts. This is what this is about. Mostly.&amp;#x200B;1. EvaderThese players don't want to get hit. Plain and simple. Classic evader signs is someone that rolls, spot dodges, air dodges, and runs away when in (perceivable) danger Evaders don't shield. Rarely if so. Evaders don't attack unless they are in a corner (edge of the stage), but usually they just roll towards the center in this situation. The one thing evaders don't consider is the fact that walking and dashing speed is actually faster, has more options and is safer than rolling or spot dodging. Inexperienced evaders will do things such as rolling to move at all. Experienced ones just do it when they feel they are in danger. The main weakness of an evader is that they are not thinking past the evasion. Basically you just have to scare them and punish where they will end up. Let go of the idea that you will strike them where they are because it's not gonna happen. Let go of the idea that they intend to stay inside for close combat. Hit and run is their game. Sweeping moves; moves that lock in place and repeat the same attack (jabs); pivot anything; projectiles; and patience is the key to beating evaders.&amp;#x200B;2. BlockerThese players place far too much faith in their shields. Classic signs you are dealing with a blocker is that they will sit on their shield for an unusually amount of time as soon as you get in a certain proximity. Blockers also commonly lead with shield without prior knowledge or data the opponent will even attack upon approach. The shield is their safe space. Oos is their motto most of the time.The mindset of a blocker is so focused on accepting and preventing the damage that they also don't usually consider walking or just dashing away out of range. Even so the knee jerk reaction to dangerous situations is to shield. For this reason experienced shield pokers and shield breakers have a field day with blockers.Their main weakness besides the aforementioned shield pokers and shield breakers are grabs. You pretty much have to find that trigger and run up and grab; drop down off a fluke aerial and grab; or just tether grab. They are also vulnerable to hard to punish sweeping attacks that go through the shield. For example Meta Knights dash attack for a universal one example. Or you can create your own. Such as a rising fade away n-air with Mario. Characters with attacks that do massive shield damage or cause shield stun are also advised. At best they may get one or two perfect shields off, but these players SIT on the shield so it will rarely happen. A few extra frames makes all the difference. &amp;#x200B;3. AttackersAn infuriating favorite for me in online lag matches. Classic signs of an attacker is going by this policy somewhat without saying it out loud: ""The best defense is a good offense!"" If you notice that during each interaction they have used a shield less times than pokemon leagues Ash has won it's a big red flag. These players fall into two categories. Unreasonably shy and hulk like aggression. The shift occurs when you put them in MILD danger.  Allow me to illustrate what I mean. Lets say the match just started. You go in for a safe approach against a Lucina. She makes an effort to swat you away as a first line of defense. However, lets say you get past that f-air or f-tilt. All of a sudden every type of attack is coming your way. They pivot a f-tilt&gt;d-tilt&gt; fade away f-air&gt; dancing blade. Remember the mindset of these players is ""The best defense is a good offense!"" For this reason the simplest manner to beat an attacker is to out space, out prioritize, and be faster than them. Now, considering that the variables become less controllable as you go down the list you wanna really focus on out spacing them. They are like evaders. Focus on where they end up and not so much where they are. This is gonna take getting punished quite a few times (OR Stocks/games) depending on your learning curve because the only way to learn their habits is by taking damage unfortunately. The shield is also a go to in these situations. It's like kryptonite to attackers. Inexperienced attackers are easily dominated by superior spacing and punishment on shield. Seasoned attackers are more so beaten by situations that force bad spacing for their play style. Such as on the edge of the stage or off it.&amp;#x200B;4. AdaptersThis type of player knows the MU. They know the safe approaches. They know their characters flaws and avoids situations that these flaws can be exploited in the specific MU. The biggest thing about adapters is that they know everything I mentioned about adapters before this point is only 50% of the match. They know the other 50% is the fight against the other player. So they adapt to the opponents play style instead of turning on auto pilot. Auto pilot is what separates the adapter from the other types. The other three are set in their ways pre game and most of the game. Maybe even post game. Adapters reflect constantly during the match so they cannot be pinned down as easily as the others.There's not much to say about their weaknesses. They have them, but it's hard to exploit. In my experience playing against adapters only two things can beat them. You either go for their spirit or their ego. If you want examples of adapters losing by means of spirit look at any pro video where he/she just sandbags after an unexpected loss or upset. Look at videos where players that are dangerous just SD or stop trying after a legit K.O.(Usually a disgusting spike or string from a character he/she does not respect due to tiers of some other bs). Breaking the spirit turns a M-16 into a Super Soaker momentarily. The other method is to go after the ego. Take advantage of complacency. For example, I was playing a Lucas and every time offstage he would go for the spike. He felt safe because I never punished it. I just waited until the last stock and used a shuttle loop for the trade to get the win. Basically put them in a false sense of security and capitalize on that much later than you would the other three types. The adapters inherently have an extremely fast combat wit. If I punished that weakness earlier I would have been up shits creek without a paddle in the endgame because it would not work twice.&amp;#x200B;\---The Take Away Here---Smash is much more of a mental battle than it's given credit for. Tier advocates abide by tournament placement and frame data like it's all that matters. That's how Brood took down M2K. Nobody expected a ""BROKEN"" character to get beat like that. I'm not shitting on tier people and I'm not stroking the mental players. I'm just pointing out how important both aspects of the game are. You might feel invincible as IC vs. Kirby in SSBB. Hell, anyone gets grabbed and that's a stock. However, the simplicity of simply grabbing one and doing a up throw on a platform stage to separate them is something that requires mental work and not just tier knowledge and frame data. &amp;#x200B;So...What type are you? Does this feel somewhat accurate in your experience? What type do you play most often online or offline? Which one gives you the most trouble offline or online?"

"Is it just me, or are there a LOT more Phantom Footstools since 3.1.0?: For some reason over the past few weeks, I've been getting footstool-esque jumps countless times but the opponent doesn't go into the animation.Normally, I don't get footstools at all, only a couple. Even now, actual footstools are the bluest of moons. Prior to 3.1.0, I sometimes got the footstool jump as part of a phantom footstool, but just as rarely. Now, though, they seem to happen pretty much once or even twice a game, sound and all.I dunno if it's just me (let alone my large list of mains/secondaries being melee/close-ranged fighters), or if there was a function touched up/a bug that's caused PFs to become far more common."

Rosalina Hitbox Showcase: 
Is it a mistake to consistantly be rotating mains?: I'm a long time smash vet that wants to always be improving and getting better.  The only thing I'm confused about is if I should change how I usually play.  I pretty much have a small group of characters I develop and really research but eventually either I get bored or more interested in others.  Some characters I return to and keep playing but never one character 24/7 for a long span of time.  Could I use this to my advantage or am I wasting my time?  I really enjoy this method because it keeps the game fresh for me.  I'm not sure if I could just play one character over a long period of time or if I'd just give the game larger breaks.  Any tips or advice on how I can combat this?

I vouch for always keeping FS charge meter on for every match. But are there some FSes that are really unfair, to the point that no one has control over avoiding them?"

"Metagame Monday 06/24/19: Welcome to Metagame Monday! Let’s all get good together. This thread is for players seeking to develop their general Smash skills, review recent tournament sets, and new players looking to learn how to Smash!While detailed and specific gameplay questions are allowed as their own threads on /r/smashbros, this is the place to ask simple and hugely open-ended questions like “Who should I main?” or “How to deal with &lt;character&gt;?” Make sure to let us know which game you're playing!Of course, feel free to ask as in-depth or detailed questions as you like.As a basic guideline for whether your question is allowed on the front page, ask yourself this:* **Is my question specific?** Vague questions like “is this character good,” “what makes this character good,” or “who should I main” are the sort of questions that belong in the Metagame Monday threads instead of on the front page. Focusing your question on a more specific part of a character’s toolkit, such as “what makes Diddy Kong’s banana so strong?” is a question that will generate focused discussion on the front page. * **Does my question give information about my situation?** The more specific and focused a question is, the more likely it is to be allowed as a thread. “How do I beat Pikachu” is a very open-ended question that gives no information about OP as a player, and belongs in this thread. “As a Lucina main, how do I seal out a stock against Pikachu (Ultimate)” is the sort of question we like to see on the front page, because it focuses discussion on your specific situation. Generally, let us know which characters you play, which parts of a matchup you struggle with or which moves you don’t know how to use, and what level of player you are.* **Does my question have an objective right answer?** If your question is something that has a definite answer, such as “is Melee Falco’s down air safe on shield,” it doesn’t belong in its own thread. Objective questions with objective answers don’t generate discussion. However, some subjective questions rely on objective elements, like “What are Falco’s best options to pressure shields in Melee,” and would be allowed.**Any and all questions about movesets, matchups, or competitive interaction are allowed in this thread!**Links to [Every previous thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/search?q=detailed+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=smashbros&amp;utm_content=t5_2qiep)**[/r/smashbros Weekly Megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/wiki/eventcalendar)*** Daily Discussion Thread: An open space to discuss everything Smash.       * Waluigi Wednesday: Memes, Rage, and general silliness!"
"The History of Melee with TrueSkill: So I went through *15 years* of tournaments  to construct every player's TrueSkill. With this data, I made charts and graphs to circlejerk the history of Melee, validate your opinions on who is the best in the game, and predict results from top 8s. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/7Qa82pt)'s the imgur album if you don't want to read.---# 1. What is TrueSkill?TrueSkill is yet another ranking system, like Elo and Glicko, made and patented by Microsoft. One key difference is that TrueSkill was made with team-based games in mind. Although the system does not aim for competitive 1v1 games like Melee, it can still create interesting data points. [Here's the wiki page for it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill)&amp;nbsp;There are a few adjustments with the TrueSkill system and the data that I'm using.- New players start at a skill value of 25, for a skill range of 0 to 50.- Games that use TrueSkill are typically best of 1, but we use the best of 3/5 format and will therefore update player's TrueSkill after each game in their set.- Pools matches will not be recorded into the data.- It counts [all](https://liquipedia.net/smash/Portal:Tournaments/All/Melee) tournaments equally. If a player sandbags in bracket, it will negatively affect their rank.&amp;nbsp;There are also a few problems in general, which remind us to take automated rankings with a grain of salt and to not push narratives with what I'm going to show you.- Inactive players stay where they are on the rank forever. This means high level players that quit at their apex will most likely remain relevant in when ranking players. (e.g. Armada still considered #1, PPMD still in top 5 after his hiatus, and on the more extreme side, Captain Jack in top 10 until 2015)- Strong players who farm their region and don't travel as much will have an inflated rank.---# 2.

[Here](https://imgur.com/AE4kBKF) were the predictions for some previous majors. Note that these all have noticeably high error. I would assume it's because a lot of these tournaments has had major upsets.

"Fortnite character idea for Smash Ultimate DLC: Now, I know that Fortnite isn't very well loved atm, and that's ok. I just figured I'd put a character from one of my favorite games in one of my favorite games and see how it goes. Thanks!Special attacks:Neutral special: Switches between 3 guns: The AR, Shotgun, and Sniper. AR fires bullets fairly fast but without much knockback or damage. They are generally easy to dodge but still useful. Shotgun has good damage and knockback but is very close range and kind of easy to punish. Sniper shoots a very fast shot with a lot of damage and decent knockback, but an entire reload animation has to play after you use it (not that long) so it is important to hit or else there is an  easy punish.Side special: Clinger. Automatically sticks to whatever it lands on, including players, floors, walls, etc. It will go off after about 3 seconds. If it is stuck to a player, it deals heavy damage and decent knockback. If it is not stuck to a player, it does   light damage but a good amount of knockback. The move is good for area control and starting/ending combos.Up special: Build up and deploy your glider. The building covers decent vertical distance and the glider acts like Peach and Daisy's parasol. Pretty good recovery, not much else to say.Down special: Picaxe bury. Large downward motion with the picaxe that buries opponents that are hit. Can be slow and kind of easy to punish.Tilts:Up: a fast, sweeping motion with the picaxeDown: Small spin with not much damage or knockback but is very fastSide: Quick stab with the pixace, pretty fast, decent damage/knockback.Smash attacks:Up: Double strike with a picaxe, then shoot up with a pistol. Happens fairly fast but has startup lag.Forward: Aims a pistol diagonally forward-downward and shoots. Decent damage and knockback but has some startup lag.Down: Ganondorf and Ike's, basically, except a bit faster with a bit less damage.Airs:Up: Quick, low damage shot from a pistoldown: throws a grenade which explodes on contact with the groundForward: Downward picaxe sweep. Spikes.backwards: Small backwards swing useful for getting enemies away.Positives: Good range and stage controlsDownside: Not much close range strength, but a bit. Can be punished if not played wellTell me what you think!"
"I am addicted to smash and I hate it.: I want to stop. But this is not possible.I'm a smash bros fan since Brawl.

I broke my mental health.With other games, even in a competitive mindset, I never had this problem. Maybe because with Smash, I wanted to push my limits. I wanted to be the best. And the best I was, at failing that is said.I dont know what to do anymore. I got rid of everything smash related in social medias. But I still took my switch and smash in order to play during breaks today. But I'm the one that is broken. I need help."
Top 8 of Blacklisted 5 is live!: 
"Is there any point to using Dedede's forward smash now that it basically can't break shield anymore?: It had basically one use outside of edge-guarding due to being ridiculously slow, and now its shield breaking potential was literally halved in 3.0, so I don't see why you'd ever bother with it at this point -- especially since with no shield break, you're basically just asking to eat a punish on block.  Also means we basically won't ever see Jet Hammer again, since shield breaking with Dedede is near impossible against strong players due to the shield damage nerfs on both Gordos and his f smash.I've been watching Zaki's matches since the patch, and he hasn't shield broken a single time with it so far:[https://youtu.be/CJg513P1Rjs?t=709](https://youtu.be/CJg513P1Rjs?t=709)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TIiDrBFTNg#t=634s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TIiDrBFTNg#t=634s)The first one was slightly charged too, and still nothing."

"What’s MKLeo’s secret sauce?: It seems that so far MKLeo has been the most dominant player in Ultimate, easily being the one with the most tournament wins and generally agreed upon as being the guy to watch out for at top level. What is it that makes him so good? He’s been playing since the Brawl days, sure, but so have several other players who haven’t reached the same levels as he has. Is he carried by the characters he picks? (Which I sincerely doubt, but could be a possibility.) Does he know how to play off Ultimate’s engine in ways that other players haven’t figured out yet? Is his playstyle uniquely challenging to face off against? Hell, is he Mang0’s son from the future under a different identity, Fire Emblem Awakening-style? What is it that has made MKLeo so dominant in the competitve scene?"

BGW is one of Japan's few major regional tournaments and happens every few months. This is the third BGW of 2019 and Shippu's second BGW win this year, the other winner being Sanne. This tournament (I believe) is the first Japanese major to use slippi; you can find the recordings here: http://tiny.cc/TokyoSlippi.2. BGW takes place in East Japan (Tokyo area). As a result, other Japanese players from West Japan such as Zoma, Rudolph, and Nanashi did not attend.2. If you are unaware of Japan's players, [their PR](https://smash.gg/rankings/melee/series/japan-ssbm-power-ranking) is a good place to start. It is essentially ""official,"" and uses a point-based system as with previous years.3. My first post of 2019! Actually quite a lot has happened. Tournaments of 2019 have primarily featured the BGW and Liquid Crystal series, totaling six East Japan tournaments in 2019.4. One noticeable name you might have noticed return is the beloved Japanese Falcon, Gucci! After a string of random hiatus', it looks like the most electrifying man in Japan is back for a while. However, despite having quite possibly the most consistent results outside of aMSa, he still is behind on claiming the #1 spot in Japan. His record against Shippu, while close, is still 1-2 against his favor, and he developed a vicious bracket demon in the form of Sanne; in the four out of six tournaments he has attended in 2019, Gucci has developed a winless 0-5 record against him. However, it's not all doom and gloom. He still is one of three players in Japan to have taken a set off of Shippu in 2019, and he was narrowly one hit away from defeating Bladewise during his visit to Japan. He historically has given even aMSa trouble in the past, so an answer to Sanne may be all he needs to push himself forward to claim it all.5. The aptly named player Sheik used to be one of the best players in Japan before his hiatus in 2014. His return in these past two years have been his slow return to form, and the absence of his bracket demon, Tokyo's only resident Falco Da-Yoshi, has allowed him to run wild in bracket. His most dominating performance was his 2nd place finish at BGW24, marking his first modern day GF appearance. In his run, he managed to take down the top two players in Japan, Sanne and Shippu. He unfortunately conceded two Grand Final sets to Shippu, but his high peaks have solidified his placing in the upper tiers of Japan. He is currently Shippu's only bad loss of 2019 and is one of the few people that can truly threaten his bracket runs. However, despite Da-Yoshi's disappearance, he has unfortunately developed another demon: the upstart, Falpan. 6. Falpan, Nagaimo, and Massun are the three musketeers of East Japan tournaments. The most prominent of the three is the Tokyo Fox, Falpan. His graduation to a top threat in 2018 has lead to an effective follow through in 2019, showing consistent top 8 finishes, defeating Sheik in every appearance. He even has a 2018 win on Shippu and will be looking to replicate that record in 2019. 7. Massun was arguably the strongest of the three, but he has been slowly transitioning to Puff, a character niche that has been starkly absent since the retirement of K.F. However, despite the transition, his records have still shown consistency rivaling Falpan, and his BGW26 performance may be indicative for results to come. He has a strong work ethic if nothing else, being one of two top players in East Japan to have attended every single East Japan tournament so far (the other being Muro). 8. Nagaimo, one of Japan's prominent Falcons, is the most enigmatic of the three. He appears the least and lacks the peaks, but has strong consistency. His lack of top wins has led to some quiet performances, but he is still strong. This tournament he defended Japan by sending the MD/VA visitor and hidden boss, MOM!, into losers.9. Shippu and Sanne have been dominating Japan in 2019. Neither of these players have finished worst than third in any of their appearances in 2019. These East Japan rivals have practically shaped the scene in the absence of other players, constantly one-uping the other in their next meeting. Shippu holds a solid 6-3 record against Sanne in 2019, but Shippu is only narrowly ahead in tournament wins: 3 victories over Sanne's two. Sanne's inconsistency to players like to Colorado's KittyMW and Shippu's overall better resume have pushed Shippu ahead of the race, but Sanne's drive to attend and face everyone in Japan for his improvement can't be matched.10. aMSa, the King of Monsters, has returned for his first appearance in a Japanese tournament in 2019 after his exhausting travels in America. After defeating gods and gatekeepers alike, aMSa's prominence in Japan shouldn't be contested. However, that's not how Shippu or Sanne saw it. Both of these players at one point were one of aMSa's biggest demons during his rise to prominence worldwide. 2018 saw a shift, and aMSa seemed practically untouchable during his brief appearances. But Shippu tasted blood and acquired his first victory over aMSa since his streak ended in early 2017 at BGW 15. Not to let himself be outdone by his rival, Sanne followed suit and eliminated aMSa into an upsetting third place. Sanne in particular was the only player in 2019 to have taken a set off of the Japanese god in 2018 and may pose to be a more consistent threat to aMSa in tournaments to come.So what does this mean for Japan? Despite only having appeared for one tournament and showing mixed results, aMSa's emphatic performances overseas can't be understated; he is still Japan's best player. However, in his absence, Shippu has claimed the throne for himself and successfully defended his argument for first place. BGW26's results can't be considered anything other than a thorn to aMSa's side, but it has also shown the strength of Japan to the rest of the world.For the rest of 2019, aMSa may enjoy that the race to be the Japanese King may put himself in the challenger's seat once more, just like he did many years before when the whole world came to know his name.-------------Battle Gateway takes place in Tokyo.

This was a weird glitch that happended vs my friend recently. Someone Explain pls: 
The snipe: 
"Robin Players of smash:: I'm looking to get Robin into elite smash (He's currently at 4,626,160 GSP) and I need help getting that final push into elite smash for him. If anyone is willing to do a Robin 1v1 with me who is in elite with him that'd be great! I'm currently trying to get characters I've never seen online into elite smash! I've gotten Wii Fit Trainer in and Robin is my second project. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
What ever happened to Project M?: The last thing I remember is them saying on their website that they are looking for other projects. Is it possible that it can take part in ultimate or something?
"An in-depth Lloyd Irving character concept that I came up with. It may be a long shot, but I think that if Lloyd were implemented like this, he could be a really unique and interesting character!: [Lloyd Irving](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tales-of-the-rays/images/5/56/-portrait-_Lloyd.png/revision/latest?cb=20170720203553) is the main character of Tales of Symphonia, one of, if not THE most popular game in Bandai Namco's Tales RPG series. Not to mention that he's a pretty popular guy in his own right. He was even featured in Smash 4 as a Mii Swordfighter costume! But alas, the costume seems to have been cut from Smash Ultimate! But... To me, that just makes it seem like he has a chance of becoming a real fighter!  So I've been thinking... How can Lloyd be made into a newcomer for Smash Bros. and actually bring something new and unique to the table? He's just another anime swordsman, right?  WRONG! Because he has two swords, and two swords are clearly stronger than one sword!  ...I kid, of course. But yes, I believe I've come up with a moveset for Lloyd that will make him unique, interesting, and really fun to play! Not to mention incorporating actual elements from his game into his playstyle! So, without further ado...  **LLOYD IRVING JOINS THE BATTLE!**  ---  **Overview**  As I said before, Lloyd isn't just another anime swordsman! I've come up with a rather unique playstyle that incorporates mechanics from Tales of Symphonia. You see, in ToS, as you level up, you can gain access to new Techs to use in battle, but even if you've hit the required level, unless you've used a prerequisite skill enough times, you won't be able to use the new move. That's what we're doing here - Lloyd has to level up his skills by using them enough times! So as he continues to fight, he'll become stronger! Of course, all of his enhanced skills go away after he gets KO'd.  In addition, unlike other Smash characters, Lloyd can actually link together some of his moves! There are rules to it though, so not every move can be linked with another. Generally, these are the rules to linking:  - Neutral normals (3 hit slash) can be linked to (almost) any Level 1 Tech. Exceptions: Sonic Thrust, Rising Falcon, Beast.  - Tilt normals cannot be linked to Techs.  - Smash attacks cannot be linked to Techs.  - Grabs cannot be linked to Techs.  - Level 1 Techs can only be further linked to Level 2 Techs.  - Level 2 Techs can only be further linked to Level 3 Techs.  - Rising Falcon/Rising Phoenix cannot be linked into or from any Techs.  - Beast/Raging Beast cannot be linked into or from any Techs.  - None of the Tiger Blade Techs can be linked into or from any of the Tempest Techs.  With all of that in mind, Lloyd actually has a wealth of different moves that he can combo with! However, the catch to linking Techs is that the knockback of any attacks performed during these kinds of combos is drastically reduced, making them effective at building damage, but poor at actually scoring a kill. There is also damage scaling applied to linked Techs, so each subsequent attack is less powerful per hit than it would be when used on it's own.  It's also of note that you can never downgrade your leveled up Techs, except by being KO'd. So that means that if you raise all of your techs to Level 2 or higher, it becomes impossible to perform linked combos without having access to Level 1 Techs. It is therefore important for players to keep an eye on the progress of their Techs (Shown by a small meter that pops up next to his portrait each time he uses a given Tech) to ensure that they can continue performing optimal combos!  And that's pretty much it! Now... On with the actual moveset!  ---  **Normal Attacks**  Neutral Normal - A 3 hit slash attack. Cannot be mashed for further hits. Can link into Level 1 Techs from any hit in the 3-hit combo.  Side Tilt - Slashes once while stepping forward, giving you a little more range than your neutral normals.   Down Tilt - Crouches and stabs. A pretty typical down tilt.  Up Tilt - Performs a jumping slash attack. Puts Lloyd in the air.  Dash Attack Lv 1 - Sonic Thrust - Steps forward and thrusts his sword outwards.  Dash Attack Lv 2 - Super Sonic Thrust - Similar to the above, but with greater range and power! Use Sonic Thrust 5 times to unlock.  Dash Attack Lv 3 - Hurricane Thrust - Has even further enhanced range and power, but also has a circular wave of wind fly out from around him that will hit enemies even if they're behind him. However, the wind wave is much less powerful than the actual thrust. Use Super Sonic Thrust 5 times to unlock.   ---  **Smash Attacks**  Side Smash Lv 1 - Beast - Performs a shoulder tackle, then follows up with an explosive energy blast in the shape of a lion's head, knocking the opponent outwards. Less powerful than his other Smash attacks, but can be leveled up to more powerful Techs, while the others cannot.  Side Smash Lv 2 - Raging Beast - Performs a spin attack with greater range than Beast's shoulder tackle, then launches the opponent with a more powerful lion-shaped energy blast. The most powerful of all of his Smash attacks. Use Beast 5 times to unlock.   Down Smash - Performs a spinning move that slashes on both sides.  Up Smash - Jumps into the air a little and slashes upwards multiple times, knocking the enemy straight up.  ---  **Special Attacks**  Neutral Special Lv 1 - Demon Fang - Fires an energy wave along the ground (or in the air) with a slash of his sword. A pretty basic projectile that travels straight.  Neutral Special Lv 2 - Double Demon Fang - Fires two energy waves this time, because two is always better than one! Use Demon Fang 5 times to unlock.   Neutral Special Lv 3 - Demonic Chaos - Fires three energy waves this time, and they're more powerful to boot! Use Double Demon Fang 5 times to unlock.  Down Special Lv 1 - Sword Rain - Rapidly thrusts his sword at foes. Good for racking up damage and setting up combos, but isn't great at knockback.  Down Special Lv 2 - Sword Rain: Alpha - Thrusts a whole bunch of times, then ends with a rising slash that knocks the foe away. Use Sword Rain 5 times to unlock.  Down Special Lv 3 - Sword Rain: Beta - Thrusts even more times! Performs the rising slash at the end, but follows up with a downward spike! Use Sword Rain: Alpha 5 times to unlock.  Side Special Lv 1 - Tempest - Flies forwards through the air by performing several slashing flips. Good at horizontal recovery.  Side Special Lv 2 - Blazing Tempest - Flies a little farther than before, but deals more damage due to his swords being on fire this time. Use Tempest 5 times to unlock.  Side Special Lv 3 - Omega Tempest - Loses the fire (but keeps the strength), but now flies even farther than before, and even gets an extra vertical boost at the end. Use Blazing Tempest 5 times to unlock.  Up Special Lv 1 - Tiger Blade - Performs a leaping slash, then follows up with a downward slash while in the air. Good for vertical recovery.  Up Special Lv 2 - Tiger Rage - An enhanced version of Tiger blade that hits more times. Boosts damage and recovery potential. Use Tiger Blade 5 times to unlock this.   Up Special Lv 3 - Twin Tiger Blade - Basically just performs Tiger Blade twice. Of course, this means it has twice as much recovery potential! Remember, two is always stronger than one! Use Tiger Rage 5 times to unlock this.  ---  **Air Attacks**  Neutral Air - Spins around in midair and slashes around him.  Forward Air - A basic forward slash.  Back Air - Kicks behind him.  Up Air - Does a flip and slashes upwards.  Down Air Lv 1 - Rising Falcon - Doesn't rise at all, actually! Dives at a diagonal downwards angle, surrounded by a gust of wind!  Down Air Lv 2 - Rising Phoenix - Like the previous move, but now on fire! Deals much greater damage than it's predecessor! Use Rising Falcon 5 times to unlock.   ---  **Throws**  Grab - Lloyd sheathes one of his swords and grabs onto the foe with his free hand.  Grab Attack - Lloyd hits the foe with the handle of his sword.  Forward Throw - Lloyd throws the foe forwards and follows up with a slash attack.  Back Throw - Lloyd tosses the foe back, then dives backwards into the air and delivers a followup slash attack.  Up Throw - Tosses the foe upwards and then delivers an upwards thrust.  Down Throw - Lloyd slams the foe on the ground, then performs a diving thrust on top of them!  ---  **Final Smash**  Final Smash Lv 1 - Falcon's Crest - Lloyd creates an energy field around him that launches the foe into the air. He jumps up, charges up energy and delivers a crushing downward slash that causes a huge energy explosion!  Final Smash Lv 2 - Unison Attack: Cross Thrust - Lloyd dashes forward and thrusts at his foe. If he connects, you're treated to a cinematic attack where Genis, Colette and Kratos appear! Genis drops Meteor Storm on the opponent, Colette blasts them with the light of Judgment, then Lloyd and Kratos join together for the powerful Cross Thrust Unison Attack, slashing a huge X shape across the field with their foes in the middle! Use Falcon's Crest once in order to use this Final Smash!  ---  So... What do you think?  Edit: [You can see many of these moves in action in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt-2ji5mnuc)"

Back to back zero to death with Falcon: 
"/r/Smashbros 25 Best in 25 Days, Day 0.: 2019 has been one of the most unbelievable years to be a Melee fan, and there seems to be almost no consensus on who the #1 player is, or even the next 25 or so. So I thought I'd bring back something I'd seen back in 2015 and 2016.Here's how it works: Everyday there will be a poll with 6 options, which you will rank in order of which you think is the best of the options, to the worst of the options. After 24 hours, the polls will close and a winner will be chosen. They will then be replaced by another player in the following day's poll. In order for a player to make it in the poll, someone must nominate them in the comment section. Whoever has the most upvoted nomination makes it in the following day.Now in past versions of this, we simply took the top 6 of the previous MIOM rankings for day 1, but given the circumstances that would unfairly eliminate some genuine contenders for 1st place, so instead we'll have a day 0 to get our first 6 players, with the top 6 most nominated players getting in. **Nominate away.**This idea was inspired by u/newbzoors series, [2015's 30 best in 30 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3vylz4/rsmashbross_30_best_in_30_days_day_1/).Any questions?"

During each of these shots after the first, you can hold right or left to adjust Corrin's angle while not fully comitting to going completely diagonal or completely vertical.Another thing, Corrin's aerial momentum is better than the distance she gets for her forward angled up b, so try to save your up b for as long as you can if you want the maximim horizontal distance. This also applies to the vertical distance as well, but to a lesser extent. This is why I didn't immediately use up b when I could've in the video, or I would've missed the ledge. Either that, or Corrin just has a bigger hitbox for grabbing the ledge behind them.Finally, using Corrin's back air as soon as you launch yourself with side b will interupt some of the momentum you get from side b, so to get the most horizontal distance, you have to wait a bit before using it."
Least favourite type of character?: For example a lot of people hate zoners or heavies or swordies but personally for me rushdown combo heavy characters are my least favourite to play against.

"My Friend Constantly Johns: Hey r/smashbros, I need your help. I have a friend, who for this post I will refer to as *John*. John is a friend I made in highschool through game club. We're both very nerdy and largely have bonded over that. And perhaps the greatest bond we have is over Super Smash Brothers - at this point, we've likely played over 200 hours of it together. We both have a lot of overall game knowledge and pride ourselves (as cringy as this may be) in putting time into learning about this game. Well, whenever we play, almost every single game, he johns. Habitually. He claims that the combos he sees other people pulling off just don't work for him. And that moves often times just aren't safe on shield for him when they are for everyone else. He'll also make clear mistakes that damn near everyone makes - tilting instead of smashing, smashing when he meant to do a turn around grab, doing the wrong option because of the buffer system, spot dodging too late - but then claim his controller (which is admittedly the joycons) is broken and that the game is choosing options for him.I've pretty much confronted him about all these and expressed how ridiculous it is to think combos don't work only for him, that he must be doing them wrong, that everyone experiences those weird buffer mistakes and misinputs. But it hasn't stopped. We both have such a strong passion for smash, but it hurts me so much that he is in denial about his own misunderstandings and gets angry so often.Is there anything I can say or do to help John? Because I'm really running out of ideas...."
Nice shot [insert Samus main]: 
"Characters that took a while to click with you?: I main Pichu and Joker and I enjoy both, but with the my enjoyment of the latter I wanted to try my hand at Sheik, who's pretty similar to Joker. The main reason is that she ticked a few boxes for a character I'd like to play. Mainly,1) Fun combos2) Cool design or from a game I love3) Fun kit that isn't based on having 800 projectilesThing is, I suck at Sheik. However, I tried her again recently and something just clicked. And now, I'm having a lot of fun with her combos. She can't kill for shit but I really don't care. Comboing is really fun with her.Anyone else had a similar experience?Edit: Fixed some grammar"

"Mother Brain moveset concept: Made this a long while back, decided to share it. If I come up with more in the future I might post them.# MOTHER BRAIN COUNTS DOWN TO SMASH!**Series:** Metroid  **Debut:** Metroid (NES, 1986)Mother Brain is the organic supercomputer and AI that serves as leader of the Space Pirates, and a recurring antagonist in the Metroid series. As an AI, Mother Brain coordinates the Space Pirates' movements and tactics which the Space Pirates OTHER leader, Ridley, then puts into practice. While she has not appeared in every Metroid game, she has served as the final boss in two (three counting remakes) games and her concept of an AI inhabiting a brain-shaped organic machine has been re-used for the Aurora Units (Metroid Prime series), Security Robot B.O.X. (Metroid Fusion) and Master Brain (Metroid Prime: Federation Force), plus her AI was used as a basis for MB (Metroid: Other M). Thus while she hasn't appeared in as many games as Ridley has, she shares his position as ""main antagonist"" due to the far-reaching effects of her few appearances.In most battles within the Metroid series, Mother Brain is a stationary figure that must rely on the artillery and traps built into the room she occupies due to either being defenseless (Metroid) or having minimal attacks (Metroid: Zero Mission). However, in Smash she instead has a slightly altered design in the form of her capsule being mounted onto a mobile weapons platform. This not only essentially allows her to bring the weapons in her room with her, but it also grants her six insectoid legs that allow movement in battle and more conventional attacks. Additionally, to represent her legacy she draws moves not only from her own battles, but from some of the enemies that were inspired by her listed above.  ***Gameplay Stats*****Size:** Very large (Ridley)  **Weight:** Very heavy (Bowser)  **Speed:** Very slow (Incineroar)Mother Brain is extremely large. Her capsule alone that holds her brain and serves as a ""body"" is slightly larger than Bowser's torso, but with the addition of her base's legs lifting her up and adding more width she is closer to Ridley in terms of size. Her weight is on par with Bowser, tying her for the heaviest character in the game, but this also makes her tie with Incineroar for the slowest in terms of both walking and dash speeds. Her heavy weight also gives her a low jump height and a fast fall speed.&amp;#x200B;***Standard Attacks*****Jab: Mother Wave**  Mother Brain releases a small blue burst of energy directly in front of her eyeball. If the button is pressed rapidly, Mother Brain releases multiples bursts as a chain straight ahead. This means that unlike most other fighters, her range increases the longer she performs her basic combo, making this great for forcing opponents back. Notably, her Jab combo has up to five hits instead of the standard three.  \-DMG: 2% per hit  **Dash Attack: Lunge**  Mother Brain leaps forward, spreading her legs and crashing down on the ground before her in an approximation of a belly flop. With her large size, this is a dangerous move that deals heavy damage and forces the opponent prone if they are unfortunate enough to get caught underneath her. However there is a significant moment of end lag after the move as Mother Brain rights herself.  \-DMG: 13%  **Forward Tilt: Ground Wave**  Mother Brain swings one of her forearms forward, releasing a series of miniature explosions along the ground in front of her. This has decent range, the explosions reaching roughly one again of Mother Brain's own body width and deal a lot of damage and knockback, and the wide spread makes it a good counter against dodging. The biggest flaw is a brief moment of lag as Mother Brain swings her leg before the explosions appear, telegraphing the move. This can be overcome by using the move at close range; the opponent will be hit my Mother Brain's limb, not only taking additional damage but will be forced back and left open for the explosions. Even if shielded against, the high damage and multiple hits will do a serious number on the recipients shield and more-than-likely break it open.  \-DMG: 14%  **Up Tilt: Capsule Rise**  A simple move, Mother Brain plants her legs into the ground and thrusts her main body upwards, ramming the opponent with the top of her capsule. A straight-forward rising move designed to be used on a falling/airborne opponent, the rise itself is deceptively fast and her large body gives it a wide hitbox. However the range is also comparatively low compared to Mother Brain's projectiles, making it a more situational move and not one to be relied on.  \-DMG: 10%  **Down Tilt: Foreleg Strike**  Mother Brain draws one of her front legs back and quickly stabs the ground in front of her, before repeating the motion with her other leg. This is one of Mother Brain's quickest attacks, even with the two individual strikes, but it is significantly weaker and has limited range. Much like her Capsule Rise it's more of a situational move, in this case intended to deal with aggressive rushdown fighters and catch opponents off-guard to set the up for other moves and strategies.  \-DMG: 4% per hit &amp;#x200B;***Aerial Attacks*****Neutral Air: Gyro Legs**  Mother Brain spins the lower segment of her base, causing her legs to rotate around her entire body. Like her Foreleg Strike it is a comparatively fast attack that can easily catch opponents off-guard while she's in the air, due to covering both her front and back, but at the cost of her usual range and power. As stated, it is best used to protect Mother Brain while she is in the air rather than used as a killing move.  \-DMG: 8%  **Forward Air: Laser Shot**  Mother Brain leans forward and releases a thin yellow laser from her eyeball straight ahead. Though not as powerful as her other projectiles in terms of knockback the laser does good damage and stopping power. On top of this it has some of the best range of her projectiles, rivaling the Belmont's whip, and it comes out extremely fast. There is a moment of end lag upon firing the laser, but this is compensated for by the laser's impressive range. Correct usage of this move involves essentially ""sniping"" an opponent before the end lag can be a problem.  \-DMG: 10%  **Back Air: Back Burn**  Mother Brain leans forward slightly and releases a blast of fire from her underside engines in the general area behind her. The blast has a large area, not much smaller than Mother Brain herself and essentially turns the entire area behind her into one large hurtbox. In addition to the high power and knockback of the attack, this makes this move very useful for killing approaching opponents, especially as it is one of Mother Brain's few moves that hit behind her for decent damage. This is counteracted by lag at both the start and end of the move, necessitating careful timing on Mother Brain's part.  \-DMG: 12%  **Up Air: Exhaust Blast**  Mother Brain releases a burst of flame from her underside engines to propel her upwards slightly. On the surface, this is more or less an aerial version of her Capsule Rise and seems just as situational as that move i.e. only to be used against overhead opponents. However, Exhaust Blast comes with the addition of the blast from under her, which not only does solid damage but also acts as a Meteor Smash. Combine this with the way Exhaust Blast lifts her into the air and you have one of Mother Brain's most versatile moves; striking opponent's both above and below, causing consistent KO's if over pits and assisting her in escapes, movement and recovery.  \-DMG: 6% (capsule), 10% (fire)  **Down Air: Laser Sweep**  Mother Brain's eye glows purple for a brief moment before she releases a thin purple laser to sweep underneath her. The sweep as expected gives this move a wide arc and much like Back Burn turns almost the entire area under her into a hurtbox, and has very good range. Though its fairly slow on startup it also does decent damage though with minor knockback. If the laser happens to touch any part of the ground while Mother Brain is in the air, it will also cause a very small explosion similar to her Ground Wave attack, which has far greater knockback. As such, in the air this move is best used for keeping opponents beneath Mother Brain at bay, while nearer the ground it is better suited to KOing opponents.  \-DMG: 4% (laser), 12% (explosions)   ***Smash Attacks*****Forward Smash: Brain Blast**  Mother Brain's eye flashes for a moment before she releases a large purple fireball from it. This move is very similar to Mega Man's Forward Smash save for the colour and lack of charging; the fireball is of a similar size to the Charged Mega Buster and moves at the same speed. Lacking the charge needed means that the Brain Blast comes out somewhat quicker in practice. As such this is one of Mother Brain's best offensive moves.  \-DMG: 22%  **Up Smash: Missile Quartet**  A panel opens up at the top of Mother Brain's capsule and releases four small missiles which move a short distance upwards before exploding. Unlike Mother Brain's other ""Up"" moves like Capsule Rise, this is one of Mother Brain's more devastating moves due to the range, power and wide hitbox of the missile explosions. The missiles come out shockingly fast considering their power with minor start-up lag. The only real flaws with this move are that the missiles only fly upwards and cannot be controlled like Samus or Snake's Side Specials, and that like those specials the missiles explode when they hit an opponent or a structure and therefore cannot be used effectively without substantial space above Mother Brain. If used effectively to overcome these flaws, Missile Quartet can be a deadly ant-air tool and an easy method of gaining Star KOs.  \-DMG: 24%  **Down Smash: Grenade**  Mother Brain drops a grenade from her underside which after a split-second explodes, releasing a ""wave"" of explosions on either side. As with Missile Quartet, this does a lot of damage in a wide radius, acting as a more grounded version of Missile Quartet or a boosted version of Ground Wave. However like Ground Wave this move is also telegraphed and has noticeable lag at the start due to dropping the grenade, making it easy to see coming and shield or dodge. Unlike Ground Wave this is compensated for by allowing Mother Brain to move upon dropping the grenade, whether it has exploded or not. So while it is a powerful move, it is best used for terrain control or to cover Mother Brain's movements, forcing opponents into position for set-ups rather than outright KOs.  \-DMG: 25%   ***Grab Game &amp; Throws*** **Grab: Cable Grab**  Mother Brain releases a claw-tipped cable from her base, firing it forward to grab and opponent and pull them closer. It is roughly the same length as Samus's grapple beam, but unlike most of Mother Brain's moves has little-to-no lag and the cable fires out very quickly, compensating for Mother Brain's own slow movement speed. If need be, she can tether recover with this.  **Pummel: Electric Shock**  Mother Brain releases a shock of electricity through the cable, electrocuting the unfortunate opponent. Same as most pummels; minimal special properties aside from the electric effect, intended simply to wrack up damage.  \-DMG: 1.5% per hit  **Forward Throw: Psycho Blast**  Mother Brain's eye glows white and she released a burst of energy at the opponent. Despite being a throw, this does almost no knockback to the unfortunate opponent. Instead, it has longer than average hit-stun to leave the opponent vulnerable. This means that rather than being used to toss opponents away or to gain KOs, this throw is better suited to set-ups and to open an opponent up to one of Mother Brain's projectiles.  \-DMG: 9%  **Back Throw: Grab 'N' Slam**  Mother Brain grabs the opponent with one of her legs, turns, and slams them hard into the ground. Just like with Psycho Blast this lacks the knockback of most throws, instead leaving the opponent prone on the ground like Snake's Down Throw. It does this for the same reason as Psycho Blast; it leaves the opponent open to further attacks rather than serving as a launch move.  \-DMG: 10%  **Up Throw: Overhead Fire**  Mother Brain tosses the opponent into the air above her head and releases a burst of energy at them from the top of her capsule. This is her only traditional throw, launching the opponent upwards with heavy knockback even at low damage and can both score Star KOs and serve as set-ups with Mother Brain's anti-air moves like Capsule Rise or Missile Quartet.  \-DMG: 8%  **Down Throw: Engine Burner**  Mother Brain lifts herself up, placing the opponent under her before roasting them with her underside engines. Unlike Psycho Blast or Grab 'N' Slam this move does significant knockback, but at an odd angle for a down-throw as the blast launches the opponent diagonally up-and-forward. While this could be utilised by a savvy player, this is far less straight forward than her forward and back throws and doesn't launch the opponent as far as her Up Throw. Instead this throw is more suited as a damage dealer, increasing percentage more in comparison to her other throws.  \-DMG: 14%   ***Special Attacks***  **Neutral Special: Rinka**  Mother Brain releases a small glowing ring of energy from her capsule's base. The projectile is comparable in size to one of Samus's half-way charged Charge Shot, but it moves at a speed similar to Mega Man's Leaf Shield. Combined with the Rinka's lackluster damage and a moment's lag at both the beginning and end of firing, this move is lacking as an attacking move. However the Rinka has several unique properties. First and foremost, the Rinka will also bounce off any opponents, walls and structures that it collides with, going in the opposite angle that it was moving. In addition, during the starting lag the player can tilt the control stick to adjust the angle the Rinka is fired at; by default the Rinka will fire at a 45% angle, but akin to Ness's PK Thunder a small arrow appears when the control stick is moved. Finally and most notably, the Rinka can be destroyed by projectiles but doing so nullifies the projectile in the process. Thus while it is a poor offensive attack, Rinka is an excellent defensive move that can control an opponent's movements, strike from odd angles or ruin the opponent's set-ups. Rinka is best used to play mindgames with the opponents, keeping them constantly on their toes and distracting them from Mother Brain's other set-ups or projectiles. Mother Brain can release up to 5 Rinka at any one time; if the move is used again then the first Rinka will automatically disappear. If left alone the Rinka will dissipate on their own after 8 seconds.  \-DMG: 2%  **Side Special: Zebitite Wall**  Mother Brain releases a small capsule along the ground in front of her (or at the lowest point of Mother Brain's model if performed in the air), which moves approximately one Mother Brain body-width ahead before expanding into a Zebitite Wall. The Zebitite Wall only does damage in capsule form; once formed it is entirely harmless to opponents. However the wall acts just as that; characters and projectiles cannot pass through the wall once it is in place. Once formed the wall has an unseen stamina meter of 20% that lowers as it takes attacks. Every 7% lost causes the wall to thin before shattering upon hitting 0%. Mother Brain can have up to four walls up at any one time. Notably, Mother Brain cannot move through the walls herself and is just as vulnerable to them as other players, and unlike with Rinka Mother Brain cannot spawn more walls once the limit is hit until a previous wall has been destroyed. Fortunately Mother Brain's attacks bypass the unseen stamina gauge and destroy the walls instantly. The exceptions are her Special Attacks, all of which can pass through the Zebitite Walls unimpeded.  \-DMG: 1%  **Up Special: Rocket Boost**  Mother Brain activates the engines on her underside to launch herself into the air. This attack goes a decent distance, roughly one and a half again Mother Brain's height before putting her into Helpless. Rocket Boost resembles King Dedede's Super Dedede Jump as she simply leaps straight up into the air. Unlike Dedede she lacks a slam back down; instead the main offensive aspects of the attack come from Mother Brain either ramming an opponent on the way up or from the flames she releases under herself while rising. A straight-forward recovery move that is somewhat hampered by Mother Brain's heavy weight.  \-DMG: 4% (ram), 3% (fire) &amp;#x200B;**Down Special: Sentry Cannon**  Mother Brain lowers her main body down to the ground, placing a Sentry Cannon onto the ground. Sentry Cannons are small turrets with a single gun that fires projectiles. These projectiles are small but fast yellow pellets, not unlike Mega Man's Jab, that do minimal damage. Sentry Cannons are very small, around half of Kirby's size, and opponents can pass through them unimpeded. They can be attacked and destroyed by the other players like Rinka and Zebitite Walls, and like Zebitite Walls they have an unseen stamina meter of 5%. Once placed a Sentry Cannon will attack once every second, automatically aiming at whichever opponent is nearest. Like Rinka, the low attack power means this move will not earn Mother Brain any KOs. However it adds more projectiles and attacks for the opponent to worry about, and the attacks are more frequent and focused than Rinka. This has the downside that it is more predictable than Rinka but it does its job of dividing the opponent's attention, especially when used in conjunction with Rinka and Mother Brain's other attacks. Mother Brain can place up to six Sentry Cannons at once, and like Zebitite Wall cannot place more until one is destroyed either by the opponent's or her own hand.  \-DMG: 1%  **Final Smash: Final Conflict**  Mother Brain retracts her legs and focuses energy into her eye before firing a large laser beam straight ahead. Anyone hit by the beam is caught in a cinematic where the opponent(s) look up to see Mother Brain towering over them in her humanoid body from Super Metroid. Her eye glows brightly before she releases a multicoloured beam of light at the hapless opponent(s), dealing rapid damage before the cinematic ends and they are launched.  \-DMG: 5% (initial beam), 40% (cinematic beam)  ***Playstyle Summary***Mother Brain is a unique character in Smash as she is a heavyweight fighter like Bowser, Ganondorf and K. Rool, but unlike them she overcomes her slow speed through powerful projectiles rather than devastating close-range attacks. Thus, Mother Brain is at her strongest when she is at mid-range. If the opponent is out of Mother Brain's range, the player should use her Rinka and Sentry Cannons to annoy and distract the opponent while launching as many projectiles as possible to cover your approach. Once she is in position, utilise her Ground Wave and Brain Blast to try and KO the opponents. If they attempt to attack from above, her Missile Quartet is the best option unless platforms are in the way. Try to avoid engaging opponents in the air if possible; Mother Brain's weight makes aerial combat difficult for her. If it can't be avoided, take out opponents with her Laser Shot and Laser Sweep attacks, and if the opponent tries to get in close use Gyro Legs, Exhaust Blast or Back Burn to give yourself breathing room depending on the situation. If opponents are being fast and aggressive, and not giving you time to think, Zebitite Wall can be used to block them off and give you time to re-assess the situation. But if you get an opening, use Cable Grab to pull them to you and either Psycho Blast or Grab 'N' Slam to set them up for one of your more powerful Smash attacks. &amp;#x200B;***Extras*****Entrance Animation**  Mother Brain's capsule is already set on the stage. Upon the battle starting she opens her one eye, unfolds her legs from under it and enters her idle stance.  **Boxing Ring Title**  Mad Overseer  **Kirby Hat**  After inhaling Mother Brain, Kirby a single round eye on his forehead, between his own eyes, along with several grey spikes poking out of his head. He gains the ability to use Mother Brain's Rinka special, though rather than firing it he instead spits them out of his mouth.  **Taunts**  \-Mother Brain braces her legs before rotating her capsule to look behind her, then rotating back to her standard position, before doing a full 360 rotation.  \-Mother Brain's eye glows and she focuses energy into it, as if preparing for her Final Smash.  \-The glass on Mother Brain's capsule shatters and falls apart, only to quickly lower a new one around her.  **Victory Theme:** A frantic, menacing version of the usual Metroid win theme.  **Victory Animations**  \-Mother Brain lowers her body and retracts her legs, her eye flashing menacingly.  \-Mother Brain rises up on her Super Metroid/Final Smash body, letting out a roar at the screen.  \-Mother Brain is blocked by several Zebitite Walls, but she destroys them all with one leg sweep and the camera zooms in on her eye.  **Palutena's Guidance**  **Pit:** What's this thing? The Chaos Kin's big brother?  **Viridi:** Oh, I wish.  **Palutena:** That's Mother Brain, Samus's archenemy.  **Pit:** I thought Ridley was her archenemy?  **Palutena:** She... has a lot of archenemies.  **Viridi:** Mother Brain is a living computer designed by the ancient Chozo that somehow gained self awareness, and now leads the Space Pirates alongside Ridley. It now seeks to bring total order and unity to the universe.  **Palutena:** Wow, you certainly know a lot about her, Viridi.  **Viridi:** I know a lot about IT, because IT is an ABOMINATION! It's an unholy mix of genetic tampering and machinery, a perversion of nature! Not to mention it's just gross to look at.  **Pit:** Wait, if she's trying to bring about order, doesn't that mean she's on our side?  **Palutena:** Not quite. Mother Brain's idea of ""order and unity"" is enslaving anything that isn't her, and destroying anyone that dares to stand in her way. You've seen the Metroids, right? She plans to use them as a weapon in her galactic conquest.  **Pit:** That's horrible! She has to be stopped, right away!  **Palutena:** That's the spirit, Pit! Thankfully, Mother Brain relies very heavily on projectiles. She'll try to distract you with her Rinka rings and Sentry Cannons, but just keep the focus on Mother Brain.  **Pit:** Projectiles, huh? Time to bust out my Guardian Orbitars!  **Palutena:** She may try to keep you back with her Zebitite Walls, so you'll have to destroy them to get to her.  **Pit:** Hiding behind walls? What a coward!  **Viridi:** Says the coward hiding behind his shields.  **Palutena:** If you can get in close, don't let her scare you. Mother Brain is big and strong, but she's slow. So just keep your wits about you and you should be fine.    **Alternate Costumes**  \-Pink flesh, grey-black mechanics \[Space Pirate AI\]  \-Orange flesh, grey-brown mechanics \[Final Conflict\]  \-Brown flesh, silver mechanics \[Original Battle\]  \-Red flesh, blue/green mechanics \[Security Robot B.O.X., Green Team\]  \-Grey flesh, black/red mechanics \[Aurora Unit 313\]  \-Yellow/white flesh, pink mechanics \[MB, Red Team\]  \-Purple/grey flesh, yellow/green mechanics \[Captain N\]  \-Purple flesh, blue mechanics \[Blue Team\]  ***Classic Mode Route*****Name:** *Planned Obsolescence*  **Round 1** \- vs Mr. Game &amp; Watch  \[Stage: Flatzone 2\]  **Round 2** \- vs Pit  \[Stage: Skyworld\]  **Round 3** \- vs Young Link  \[Stage: Great Bay\]  **Round 4** \- vs Snake  \[Stage: Shadow Moses Island\]  **Round 5** \- vs Mega Man  \[Stage: Wily's Fortress\]  **Round 6** \- vs Fox &amp; Wolf  \[Stage: Lylat Cruise\]  **Round 7** \- Bonus Game  \[Stage: Bonus Game\]  **Round 8** \- vs Galleom  \[Stage: Galleom's Stage\]"
"Paperboy for smash: a character theory: With two fighters left in the fighters pass to be announced, I doubt it will be Paperboy, from Paperboy.

"First Tournament Experience, First Salty Player Experience: I originally posted this on r/SmashBrosUltimate but people told me that posting it here would be a better place for a discussion, so here it is! Yesterday I went to my first Smash tournament ever. I don't consider myself an amazing player, I would say that I am pretty decent, and I hoped to get pretty far in bracket, but I didn't expect to get into the semi finals or anything, (I'm a Yoshi main for anyone curious). For the most part, it was really fun! I had many fun and exhilarating matches, and it was fun to watch my friends play and cheer each other on! One of my friends even made it up to semi finals and it was so amazing to watch his intense match!Now putting all the fun stuff aside for a sec, I did however have one encounter that almost completely ruined it all for me, and that was a Salty Mario Player (SMP). Now don't get me wrong, I was aware that there are people like that at many tournaments, I was just hoping I wouldn't have to encounter one, since I never really have before in my life, (boy wasn't I lucky). I met this Mario in loser's bracket after I won my first match, then lost my second match in singles. He was very quiet at first, and all he really said to me was, ""We're going to Poke Stadium 2,"" which I didn't deny because I like that stage, it's a decent stage for Yoshi players...I think. It was going pretty well in the beginning, but once I took one of his stocks, he started to get toxic. SMP would mumble things to himself saying how bad I was or how bad he was and other nasty comments. It was a very close first match but I ended up winning, which caused him to be a little more ""expressive"" and slap his leg out of rage, and then immediately afterwards he would yell in my face ""RUN IT BACK!"" Now for those who don't know, when someone wins a match, they get to choose what stages they want banned, and the loser chooses the next stage out of the rest. Despite this rule, he refused to accept that I banned the stage we were just on and continued the match. Now any normal person would call him out and refuse to listen to him, but I am **HORRIBLE** with social situations. Because of this, the dude was kind of scaring me to the point where I couldn't really speak. I got all shaky and flustered and, for the next 2 matches, I did really bad and he ended up winning, making me feel so awful. Coming to the tournament was a huge step out of my comfort zone, but I was able to push myself to try it out. After the match, My friends, who were watching me play, and I then reported the situation to the TO, but SMP refused to do anything about it. He wouldn't do another match and was just rude to me the whole time. I understand that it would be a little scummy of me to make him replay another game even though he ""technically"" won, and because of that, the TO just let it go and said that he won, but I still think it was totally unfair of him to do that to me. His friends even started insulting me, calling me scummy and weak for doing that. They seemed like they had no idea that his friend is a complete toxic maniac when he starts losing, and that I was an inexperienced tournament goer.With this experience, I am a bit worried about future experiences with other smash tournaments, but I feel like I will give it another shot once the opportunity comes again. The rest of the people I met were very nice and respectful though, so that made things a lot better! To end of with some good news though, the next opponent SMP faced was a really nice and really good Lucina player, who just BODIED him! SMP did the same thing to the Lucina player as he did to me, refusing to go only to Poke Stadium 2, except this time he lost both times. After the match, SMP slammed the table, slammed his controller, and booked it out of the building, not even staying for the rest of the whole tournament. That did make me smile a little bit, it was nice to see that karma came back to bite him in the butt.Despite being very happy that happened, it is still somewhat bothering me that I completely flunked my match because of someone just being so toxic and not caring about anything other than being good, and since I've never really experienced someone like that before, I don't know how to deal with him or other people like that in the future. If anyone has any advice for how to deal with situations like that, it would be much appreciated! Thanks for reading!"
"Anyway to improve ping?: Online games seem very inconsistent for me. Very rarely I'll get a game where everything seems to run smoothly. Most of the time a button press won't register the first time round, even when trying to dash I'll turn the stick to the side and my character will just stand there sometimes, forcing me to do it a second time. On top of this sometimes it registers actions twice, I'll roll once to one side and sometimes it triggers a second one. &amp;#x200B;My controller is fine as it works completely fine offline. Maybe I should just stick to offline mode with friends if there's no easy fix for my connection."
Whats some of the weirdest / strangest places a smash tournament has been held at?: I've heard of a smash tournament being held in a catholic church before and thought that was pretty strange. Has there been other weird places a tournament has been held that you have been to or know of? &amp;#x200B;EDIT: I did not know it was common for churches to host events such as these and other things. cool to know!
"Did I miss a memo or something?: I’ve been grinding quick play for a while trying to break my main back into elite and for whatever reason, about half of all the matches I’ve play today have been against captain falcon. Not just the same few either, different tags, playstyles, stages (Heck you guy who took me to pac-land). Are people still just hyped about the buffs or is the matchmaking just doing its thing and I’m crazy?"

"Castle Crashers moveset?: I randomly thought of this while I was in bed and I had to get my ideas down somewhere. I’ll show what I thought of and you can comment what you think would be cool as well.To preface, this moveset would be a collection of different character magic and pets.-Specials-[Up-Special]This should obviously be the magic jump, it could really be any of them. Perhaps working similar to inklings but without the hit box on the landing and they’d be able to act out of it. [Down-Special]This could be their gimmick, this would scroll through their items like the bow, bombs, and sandwich. There would definitely be a cool down for the sand witch and bombs so they wouldn’t be easily spammed.[Neutral-Special]This is where they would use the item they picked using down-b, the bow wouldn’t be able to be charged, however when used in the air, it could boost the player up a bit similar to king k rool’s up air.The bombs would drop at the players feet and have a fair bit of knock back, the player should get hurt from the blast if near it.The sandwich is tricky since in the game you can be buff for 10 seconds I’m not really sure how exactly to balance it. It could just be something like shulks smash art. It should have a considerable cool down.[Side-Special] This would simply be the fully upgraded starting magic move in castle crashers. Although it should have a mana bar to balance it.-Aerials-[Down-Air]This would be the heavy attack from castle crashers when used in he air. It’s hard to describe but it would be a strong aerial with a small spike hit box.[Forward-Air]This would just be a simple swipe in front of the knight, except it wouldn’t be able to juggle enemies endlessly as it could in the original game. [Neutral-Air]This would have them spin the sword around them like Simon and richters nairs. (This is in the game btw)[Up-Air] The up air would be an improvised move where they stab their sword upwards like all the links do.-Tilts-This is where pets come into the mix![Forward-Tilt]This attack should have the ram do a short charge in front of the knight. It would have similar damage and knock back to DK’s f-tilt.[Down-Tilt]This would have the frog pet stick their tongue out close to the floor. Not much else to say.[Up-Tilt]This would be a short uppercut with the sword similar to mega mans.This is all I have to share right now, sorry for not having pictures for reference, if you have anything to add please comment down below!Edit: I just thought that their final smash could be more of the knights coming in doing all sorts of attacks and magic while having it end with the treasure chest dropping in them."
"What would updated wiimote character select voices sound like?: I miss these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eXhHuGTx0wWould love to know what these would sound like if they were updated somehow. For example Shulk could get ""I'm really feeling it!"" and Palutena would do her ""ahahahaha"" laugh. I imagine some veterans would get updated voices too."

PPMD does an ASMR match analysis: 
"How did you get into Super Smash Bros. ?: When I was seven, my stepfather brought home a copy of Super Smash Bros. Brawl and let me play it. I had no idea who any of the characters were minus the Mario, Pokemon, and Kirby ones, and it made me fascinated with the characters and the stories that the game told. One of the major events in my life that turned me into a dedicated gamer."
"Where to start as a recent “convert”?: So I’ve been playing fighting games seriously since I was 6 years old (15now) so I have some fighting game background, mostly In the street fighter series. I played brawl and smash 4 to the level where I thought I was ok but I had no idea how smash was actually played. So I picked up a switch and got smash bros along with a hori gamecube wired controller. Any idea where I should start learning? My friend suggested combos but I’m used to having set true combos, and smash has many different mechanics like DI. Can you guys help me out?"

Saturday Night Smash Bros Ultimate: 
"Akira Howard - Brawler Concept (Astral Chain Rep): **Who?**: The protagonist of Astral Chain is nameless but their twin brother/sister (who looks the same), is named Akira Howard, so we will go with that!**Backstory**: Astral Chain focuses on a special police force trying to save the world from inter dimensional beings known as Chimeras with the Legion, a living weapon, by their side! You can see the announcement trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brmmV3g4qqo)  and the E3 trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Nos2x1P9U) !**Map**: Ark, a futuristic city maybe it can be a like a cross between Shadow Moses Island and Midgard (or just like Midgard), and has some stage hazards in the form of giant monsters...#Normal Moveset**Normal Attacks**- *Jab*: Akira strikes multiple times with a baton (which transforms into an energy gun for other attacks).- *Up Tilt*: Similar to jab but directed upwards to send opponents flying.- *Side Tilt*: Similar to the jab but Akira reaches forward a bit more. Also the baton is flowing with energy.- *Down Tilt*: A simple leg sweep.- *Dash Attack*: Akira dashes shoulder forward and elbows the opponent.**Aerial Attacks**- *Neutral Air*: Similar to Side Tilt but in the air and has a rounder hitbox (around Akira instead of right in front of him/her).- *Up Air*: Similar to Up Tilt but glowing with energy.- *Back Air*: Akira spins around with the baton in hand, glowing with energy as nearby opponents are hit.- *Down Air*: Akira drops down with both legs fairly quickly kind of like Corrin, minus the spikes (I think other brawlers have a similar attack as well).**Smash Attacks**- *Up Smash*: Akira’s baton glows with energy (more so than other Attacks), then strikes upward leaving behind a trail of energy.- *Side Smash*: Kind of like Corrins, this does some damage as it charges up and Akiras baton glows before turning into a gun and firing a beam of energy forward. Can be influenced by tilting.- *Down Smash*: Akira charges up his/her baton gun and fires it at the floor, causing the energy to disperse on both sides.**Special Attacks**- *Neutral Special*: Akira’s Baton turns into an energy gun that fires 3 rapid shots with each click. Hold to activate/switch or cancel Legions, similar to Shulk. Legions only exist for a certain amount of time, you then have to wait for the bar to fill up on it’s own.- *Up Special*: Akira strikes upward as his/her baton turns into a giant sword!- *Side Special*: Akira throws a chain ring at the opponent (looks like Links Side Special), which stuns them.- *Down Special*: Is a reflect. Akira uses the IRIS to sense the opponent before they attack. #Akira With Legion**Note**: When Akira summons a Legion, the the gameplay becomes similar to ice climbers/Olimar. Akira keeps his/her regular attacks while Legion Attacks in the background, independently although with some Moveset changes!- *Neutral Special*: Doesn’t change unless you are using the Arrow Legion, who fires an energy arrow.- *Side Special*: Akira And Legion dash to the side entangling the opponent in a chain stunning them for a short time. Same for all legions except for the Beast Legion, where Akira rides it and lunges forward.- *Up Special*: Akira and Legion jump upwards similar to ice climbers Up Special (Belay).- *Down Special*: Akira switches control with Legion, unlocking a completely new Moveset. Although the Side Special And Up Special mentioned above stay the same. Use the Down Special to Switch again.#Legions**Sword Legion**: Attacks are similar to Akira but uses its blade arms instead of a baton, and instead of shooting, its arms glow with energy before striking, releasing a beam similar to Clouds Side Special.**Arrow Legion**: Same As Sword Legion but fires arrows out of its arms.**Beast Legion**: Moveset is filled with lunges and swipes.**Arm Legion**: A heavy hitter, similar to Sword Legion but Attacks do more knock back than damage. **Axe Legion**: Similar to Sword Legion but much slower and does more damage.#UltimateAkira goes in a mode similar to Bayo’s Ult but styled like IRIS. All enemies that are attacked are targeted in the Final Smash. Like a number of Final Smashes, multiple characters are in it. A number of the main characters in Astral Chain join, each with a Legion, they wrap around the opponent trapping them before slashing/firing at them multiple times... Idk."

"Z Grabbing while your character is sliding causes the game to input an attack: Title. While labbing Ice Climbers I started noticed whenever I would try to desync by pivot grabbing I would instead input a forward smash. I don't know why this mechanic exists, and I would love for it to not exist. If I press Z on the ground I want to grab. If I'm trying to pivot grab I shouldn't be punished with a smash attack.[Here](https://youtu.be/nnl16tVnbBk) is an example of what I'm talking about. All I was pressing was Z and the left stick. 4 different commands are bound to this one button, and is all about timing. If your timing is off you're gonna get punished hard.My current hypothesis is that when an action interrupts the ability to Shield, it follows through with the A input causing an attack to come out. You can't stop a dash and shield immediately, there is a brief delay, however because you can attack out of shield, the L and A input get desynced and you are left with an attack when you grab. I've also had this happen to me when trying to input a Zair."

"Is there anyway to punish super speedy play which doesn’t involve being able to react at impossible speeds?: Like I just got destroyed multiple times by a wolf and to be honest I had no idea what was going, he was empty hopping and dashing the whole time and I couldn’t punish any of it. Everytime I pressed shield I would get grabbed and attempting to dodge didn’t work because I could never get the timing of the moves. If I tried to fight back I’d just get punished super quickly. Most wolves I play online play a lot slower so I don’t have this problem but I wasn’t helpless against this, and whenever I come upon someone playing this quickly, usually jokers or falcos but foxes and greninjas as well, I find myself unable to even figure out why I’m losing, other than they were putting out a million options before I could process one."
Is Roll Cancel Boost Grab useful? How often is it used?: I barely see anyone doing the grab tech and was wondering how useful can it be. Is it really worth it?

I want to buy the nyko adapter and use a GameCube controller plugged in there, as well as the PowerA or pdp controller in the remaining USB port."
"According The the Spirit List, Stage List, and Music List, how many franchises/standalone games have some form of representation in Super Smash Bros.

"As a CF main, should I NOT be playing on Battlefield?: I recently realized that stage choice is actually pretty important when it comes to some fighters and I think that might be why I'm not able to land my single hit fast fall nair, because the platforms on Battlefield are always in the way.Should I learn to play around it or accept that it isn't realistic?"
"Which character should I pick as an opponent if I'm labbing?: I've heard about Mario being the go-to, but which character should I really practice ZTDs and True Combos on weight-wise?"

Tips on downward afterburner?: Came from bayonetta 1 and 2) I’ve been practicing for about a 2 hours now and  I can’t for the life of me hit the downward afterburner. In the games it says that in order for a downward afterburner kick to be possible you have to wait til you are in the downward arch does this translate to smash?  or is there something else is there a sweet spot or something?
"Smash Bros Controller Woes: I've never gotten used to using the C-stick when playing Smash, and I don't want to, but there are clear advantages to utilizing it.  Using a stick to perform attacks just feels so wrong, and so I'd like to find a controller that uses C buttons (a la N64) or even a D pad on the right side instead, but I haven't found the right option and could use some help.  &amp;#x200B;I use a GC style controller, but I'm not opposed to using a pro style one if it solves the issue.  I prefer the easy to push ZL &amp; ZR buttons; GC style ones have too much travel time for comfort.  Wireless is preferable, but wired is just fine if the response time is better.  And ideally, I'd want an L stick that doesn't push in for an L3 button.&amp;#x200B;Does anyone know of a controller like this that could be used for Smash Ultimate?  The closest I've found is the Retro-Bit Tribute N64 USB controller, but no X button for jumping is a dealbreaker.  &amp;#x200B;Thanks everyone!Edit:  main use for C-sticking is to do directional attacks in the air without influencing move direction"

"Looking for Mob Smash Mii Renders: The title says it all. I found out that the Fighting Mii Team in Ultimate has new designs instead of it reusing the designs in Wii U &amp; 3DS, and I'm trying to find clear ones I can use as references for a sketch idea. I would've gone in-game and take the pictures myself, but there's no free camera feature during Mob Smash, and the specific outfits I don't think show up in the classic mode runs Miis appear in. If anyone can point me in the direction of where I can find the designs for Ultimate's Fighting Mii Team, all three Mii Fighter types, please let me know."
What's the point of background matchmaking if it's not going to even give you your preferred ruleset?: Just had two games back to back in which it was definitely not the rules I had specified.  Why even have background matchmaking be a thing then?  Nintendo really needs to fix online.

"What character pallete swaps/reskins do you wish made it into the game?: There was another thread about reskins, and it got me thinking about just how many really cool missed opportunities there are as far as reskins go - especially if you move past pallete swaps and do complete remodels like they did with Hero. Somebody mentioned Meta Knight, and through some effort I realized that there's enough iterations of Meta Knight and characters like him that you could easily do 8 completely unique reskins for just that one character. You've got Meta Knight, Dark Meta Knight, Galacta Knight, Morpho Knight, Mecha Knight, Party Hat Knight, Unmasked Meta Knight, and Yarn Meta Knight.https://m.imgur.com/a/rfexfsFI'm with certain characters like Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Wario, Hero, all the Links - 8 reskins is a complete possibility.So what good reskins can you guys think of for your favorite characters?"

"Want to go to local tournaments but have social anxiety? Here are some tips.: I used to have social anxiety (still kind of do) so I completely understand. Here are some things that have really helped me, and now I enjoy socializing and cope with the anxiety pretty well.1. Understand that most people worry about themselves more than others, so don’t worry about what other people think about you.2. Learn how to smile, it makes you waaay more approachable. I literally just went to YouTube and used a trick where I put a pencil in between my teeth and I would look in the mirror to make sure it looks “okay” and not awkward.3. Be yourself. Do not pretend to be someone you are not.4. Make friends and stick with a group so you don’t feel like you’re completely by yourself.5. Don’t go to tournaments to win. Go to tournaments to improve, meet people and have fun! You will find it 100x more enjoyable"
"Out of all of the franchises shown in Smash, which ones do you think are represented incorrectly?: Now, I’m not saying in terms of fighter amounts or stages shown. What I do mean are franchises shown off in Smash games that  paint an inaccurate depiction of what their games stand for.For me, it’d be Earthbound and Fire Emblem. Earthbound because it’s not an accurate depiction of the weirdness and/or the darkness of the actual games. Their stages kinda miss that sort of charm that the games had where you can tell it’s a different kind of RPG. The style Smash goes for makes it seem like Earthbound is more like a cartoony open-world game. The series isn’t truly all fun and games because it goes through heavy themes such as genocide, dictatorships, parental abuse, sexual and gender identity, and more. It’s hard as all hell to get my friends into EB because of this, not helped at all by the fact that Ness and Lucas have, in my opinion, unreasonably, been made the posterboys of cheap characters. And this is coming from a Ness main who loves Earthbound.Fire Emblem, well, I’d say this because of how generic it makes the series appear. I don’t play the games because of how Intelligent Systems treats it over Paper Mario, my favorite trilogy of games of all time, but Smash put me further off. It makes most of the heroes appear generic in personality and their world, despite each game’s being distinct, blends together.What’s even worse is that I fully know that is not the case, that the actual games have personality, worldbuilding, and emotion to spare. That’s what makes it kinda frustrating, as I know there’s a hell lot of fans who love the franchise but it’s poorly represented.What do you guys think about this? Do you have a Franchise in Smash that’s been shown in a wrong light? Doesn’t matter if they’re a Spirit, Assist Trophy, Stage, Song, etc! I’d like to hear your two cents on this."
"What do you look for in a stream viewing experience?: **TLDR****1. What is it that you look for in a tournament stream viewing experience?****2. What is it that you look for in an independent stream viewing experience?**Hey everybody! After my time at Smash N' Splash 5 earlier this month, I got extremely motivated to get back into the swing of things with Melee in regards to grinding tech skill, studying up more on different gameplay interactions, and overall just becoming a better player and member of the community. Due to school getting in the way these past 2 semesters, my PC that I use to run dolphin shitting the bed, and not really having a scene where I go to university at, I've been unable to really give any attention to this game that brings me so much joy and that I genuinely love.To solve this issue, I've created a small to-do list for myself, including (but not limited to) streaming myself practicing, setting up a local at my university, and streaming said local. I'm currently in the process of gathering CRT's from nearby (already got 3, which is more than I expected this early in the summer lol), and getting a hold of other players on campus that would be interested in supporting and helping out with tournaments.Before I put even more time and effort into this however, I wanted to gauge your opinions in regards to what you look for in a live stream viewing experience. For both independent live streams, as well as a tournament streams, what is it that you guys look for? Are there any specific aspects that you would say are extremely beneficial? How about detrimental? Any input would be greatly appreciated, as this is something I would absolutely love to put time and effort into if it's something that people would get enjoyment out of.Thanks!"
Tea 0 to death on Zackray: 
I tried a JoJo smash thing: 
MetaEndGame: The Metagame Documentary Update: 
Buff Spinning Kong eh?: 
"I know Steve has only a very little chance now, but I had this concept done out, thought I'd post it.: Neutral B: Minecraft This is Steve's main move. When using it he punches the ground and faded images of a Sword, Shovel, Axe and Picaxe appear over his head, like Shulk's Arts. While he's punching the ground he slowly builds up resources, and his resources are displayed in a bar over his percent, like how Robin has his tomes' health. The resources Steve can gather are Wood, Cobblestone, Iron and Diamonds, Wood being the most common, Diamonds being the least. When he gets enough of a resource he can select a tool with a stick input, again, like Shulks arts. He needs one of a resource for a shovel, two for an axe, three for a sword and four for a picaxe. When he's holding a weapon, he'll use it for Smash Attacks and directional aerials, otherwise he'll use his hands. Each tool can also break with enough use. Jab, tilts and nair could be done with an assortment of different Minecraft Items. I don't really have any ideas for these, but I'm open to suggestions. The shovel gives his attacks only a minor damage buff, but makes down smash much more powerful, with a chance to bury the opponent. The axe increases the power of aerials greatly and grounded moves slightly. The Sword gives a large buff to all attacks. The Picaxe increases the likelihood of mining good materials, and the effects of each tool as well as their durability are amplified if they're crafted from better materials.Side B: MinecartSteve drives forward in a Minecart, damaging enemies he hits, however if he use the move mid-air it won't go very fast or damage opponents.Up B: Ender PearlWhen you input the move, Steve takes out an Ender Pearl that can be aimed before being thrown, like Inkling's Down B. Down B: BlockSteve can press it quickly to place a dirt block on the floor in front of himself or hold and angle the stick to place one above, below or behind himself. He can only have 3 out at a time, and they each have can be destroyed if they take 15 damage.Final Smash: Night TimeSteve quickly builds a house and goes inside. Then a bunch of Minecraft enemies will spawn and hit opponents towards the centre of the stage, where eventually a Creeper will Spawn setting off a massive explosion.Skins:Steve, Alex, Herobrine, Zombie, Skeleton, Pigman, Squidman, CowmanStage: I dunno what to call it.It's just a basic Minecraft grassland. Minecraft players will occasionally appear in the background and build things that can effect players. Eventually it'll transition to locations like the Nether or the End, sort of like Castle Siege.Spirits:Some examples of spirits could be a Creeper, an Enderman, a Wolf, a Villager, or The Enderdragon. There's no shortage of potential spirits.Other details:When he gets hit he flashes red and the sound effect from Minecraft plays.When he gets Star KO'd a message will pop up saying ""Steve Fell from a High Place"". If he dies off the bottom it says ""Steve tried to swim in the blastzone"". I'd love to hear suggestions for more. When his name appears on the Win Screen it's in the font that the title apppears in on the Minecraft Title screen.If he eats a food item it plays the eating sound effect from Minecraft."
Two of them: 
"How do you quickly/consistently do Back-air attacks?: I can do back flips just fine to do my B-airs, but I find that it sometimes takes me a while ( or not as fast as I like too ) to get my bearings of turning around, jumping backwards then attacking.I've been trying to practice a chain with Mr.G&amp;W where you do a shorthop into B-air into your opponents then quickly follow it up with another B-air. But sometimes I end up...-Taking too long to set up the first B-air. Causing me to get punished or miss the attack-Just do a F-air-Succesfully do the first B-air...only to fail at the second B-air by either taking too long or pulling out a F-air insteadAnd I'm not just talking about this chain general. I'm talking about trying to do all kinds of B-air attacks quickly and consistently! So what's the best way to do/practice quick B-airs?"

"Why does everybody think they're unbeatable in Smash?: Disclaimer: This is a legitimate question.  I am in no way implying that I am better than any of them or looking down on those who make those claims. I am also not part of the SSB community as I have only played SSB4 for a relatively brief period of time.&amp;amp;#x200B;Okay, so, why is it that I hear almost every Super Smash Bros player I encounter say essentially the same thing; that they're better than anyone else. I am an avid and season gamer in other genres (mainly MMORPGs) and I've had my fair share of experience with pretty much every other popular genre, so seeing claims of being better than anyone else are not foreign to me (Played League of Legends for a few years)... However, it would seem that the amount of people that say that in the SSB community is MUCH higher and I was wondering why. Like, I hear the most random people on the streets stating that they're either pros or semi pros. Is it because it's one of those games where it's easy to feel like you're contributing a lot to a fight when in reality it's just how the game is designed (like Overwatch)? Or maybe is it like an inside joke inside this community?&amp;amp;#x200B;Any thoughts on this?Thanks in advance.&amp;amp;#x200B;Edit 1: The amount of people that came and posted their arguments with a dash of humble brag is exactly the point I am trying to figure out. Almost nobody has considered themselves anything shy of very good.Edit 2: I am aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect. However, that is a global concept. My question is more on the lines of the specifics why it seems to be worse in this community.Edit 3: For those claiming that they've never heard the bragging. I invite you  to read the comments and notice the amount of people arguing ""I am a complete beast, but I would get stomped in a tournament"".Edit 4: Thank you so much, guys. My doubt has been cleared.Cheers."

"Quickplay unplayable - very high ping: Hey, I live in the UAE and was excited to play quickplay smash after buying a Nintendo online subscription.  Except that wasn't really the case. The input lag is between one and two seconds. Aerials are impossible to pull off, combos are impossible to pull off and my moves are repeated sometimes. For example, rushing the opponent, I would spam down B on ganon and it would completely miss - what's worse is that it would down B outside the stage when the input would have been 4-5 seconds ago.   I have a 100Mbps/50Mbps down/up connection so I am pretty sure that's not the case. The WiFi router is very close to the switch so I'm not sure why this keeps happening, it's also running on a Gigabit WiFi connection. I tried setting the MTU in the WiFi settings to 1500 but that didn't help at all, if anything, it might have made matters worse. Can I have some help regarding what to do?   Right now my GSP is 80,000 and getting lower. I'm sure it's not me because I can take down LVL 9 CPUs with 3 stocks, sometimes 0 to death."

"Trouble with getting kills: I'm struggling to find what I'm doing wrong in my gameplay. I know I could work on my input timings and reading my opponent better. However I find I struggle most with securing kills. Whenever I do kill, most of the time it's either a quick tilt or aerial at 150+% or a lucky smash attack where my opponent misinputs. Obviously I can't expect that much help since I haven't shown any of my gameplay but I'm looking for some general tips of getting early kills or reading my opponent better."

Also custom character recommendations would be cool too.

"Question From The Memoirs Of A Broke Smasher: Is there still a community for Smash 4? Basically I’ve been battling with getting a Switch at this point for a little while, before my daughter it would have been a no brainer but now I have to be a lottle more fiscally responsible with my love of games. I’d love to get Smash Ultimate, but the better choice right now would be a Wii U and Smash 4 if there’s still some kind of online community. Would this be worth it or would I be better forgoing the whole thing unless I can get a Switch and Smash?Thanks guys"

Edna Mode's worst nightmare.: 
"Challenger Lingering: Peppy Hare: Hey guys, Dreamer here and welcome to a new series called Challenger Lingering, where we set out to find out the possible candidates for Smash, and give evidence to support they would fit in move-set wise, and when it comes to the current rosters throughout the Smash timelines. Today we’ll be talking about a certain buck toothed member of Star Fox who knows a thing or two about dodging. I’m talking about Peppy Hare! Now you may be thinking, “Wait a minute, Peppy can’t fight...” Well we didn’t know Fox and Falco could fight either before Smash, and besides, he has a few tricks that could make him a good fighter. Without further ado, let’s get ready to DO A BARREL ROLL!IN THE BACKGROUNDNow, I’m may not be a Star Fox dedicated fan, but even I’ve heard THAT line before, and even I know the face that it came from, however, I barely know much else, so for this move-set and for defense of the character, I did a LOT of research. Peppy Hare originated from Star Fox 64, the first Star Fox game, and has been with the series ever since. He’s a veteran and was apart of the previous generation of Star Fox as well as the current one. He knew Fox’s father, James McCloud quite well. This could really help for a character to character moment in a Story Mode.As such, Peppy has obviously had lots of exposure to technology, and often gives the team support and tips. He’s even gone on to become a general because of his amazing knowledge of strategy and courage, which could shake the Smash roster quite a bit! Still, should he be here? At first glance there would seem to be no reason. We already have Fox, Falco, and Wolf, why do we need Peppy? Well, there is a good reason.Sakuri can’t cheese this one. 🧀 (No not really, his jobs hard, don’t go crazy on me please.)He can be a completely new character, unlike a certain three mirrors.Now before you come at me, here me out. I am well aware all three Star Fox characters actually in the game have some differences, especially Wolf. He is my main after all. Still, the point they are way too similar is a bit of a problem. Well, not a problem, more blatantly noticeable. Peppy however, can’t possibly have a copied move set. His body physically doesn’t match up! You except Peppy to do what Fox can do? I thought so. With this, we can get a COMPLETELY original move-set from Star Fox. But this point is also a problem...Well we may have the why, but we don’t have a how. Remember, Peppy is quite... Out of shape. That didn’t stop King K. Rool, yes, but Peppy’s physics are different. Not only that, but outside of Smash Bros., Star Fox characters aren’t known for fighting outside of their ships. At least not from what I know. However, this won’t be impossible, as Sakuri did manage to make a move set for Fox and Falco. And Wolf. So after much pondering, I came up with a kind of move-set, taking another character in mind, and you won’t believe who it was. Ready? Here we go!SHOWING THEIR MOVESPeppy is a heavy character with considerably normal speed, and only one jump. One. Peppy himself doesn’t usually attack, but he instead has mini fighter ships with him. 3 small ones, and one big one, big enough for him to stand on, and you actually can, but we’ll get to that later. Peppy’s normal attacks are just him making his ships fire at you. Whenever he grabs opponents too! However, Peppy can attack you himself if you’re too close. His basic close-up combo is him giving a punch from both hands and a kick to finish it off. All the will the small ships are still firing their lasers because you’re too close for comfort. Peppy’s running Attack takes a page from Bowser of all people, since it’s a weak drop kick. Still, if he hits, all of the ships he has will send a shock at you, stunning you in place and dealing much better damage. Peppy himself may deal 1% damage in this case, but with his default ships, those could deal 25% damage on top of that, so steer clear. If he misses, he’ll even slide for a bit, so there’s that as an extra reward, now he’s open.So before I said I based Peppy off of someone else. Well, he’s basically like Olimar and the Pikmin. Olimar NEEDS the Pikmin to win. Without them, he can’t do much of anything. Peppy though, is even worse, and even better. Once he loses a mini ship, it’s gone for good until he respawns or uses his Final Smash. However, they only be destroyed by explosions, and only the Smart Bomb is a guaranteed destruction of a ship. Other attacks don’t work on them. It’s like they’re in the background. But when Peppy gets on the big mini ship, it’s exposed to damage of all kinds, and if it goes, they could all go in the explosion. Still, Peppy isn’t forced to get off of the bigger ship. He can stay on there as long as he wants to make up for his bad recovery and low damage. Still, it’s not OP, Peppy has limits on his range, so you’ll get your chance to blow the ship up, or knock him off with enough force. No barrel rolls for Peppy this time. He’ll need to jump off to get away from taking damage. Peppy’s smash attacks are quite simple. He just orders his ships to charge at you. Once he loses his ships though, he throws punches that with luck, can be as dangerous as Luigi’s taunts. Still, I wouldn’t recommend it, they have a 3% chance of spiking... yeah... Now we get into specials. To be simple, here’s a list. Normal B: Bomb BarragePeppy will throw a random bomb item, sometimes even throwing an extra ship of either size, or a Smart Bomb! He may even throw a bunch of bomb items out AND one of each ship size with luck. Note: The bombs may go off before Peppy throws them in time if used too much. While this can destroy the smaller ships, it cannot destroy the bigger ones, though they will take damage.Side B: Mini Ship Type SPeppy will throw a little ship directly in front of him that will bring up a blue shield to protect him. If it’s hit, it will send three blasts in the direction it’s facing, but if it’s hit twice, the shield will break, stunning Peppy and breaking his normal shield. May shock other players as well if they are close, and there is a high likely hood if you’re the person who does the deed.Up B: MIni Ship Type RPeppy calls for his bigger mini ships, having them charge past anything in their way to get under him so he can ride one of them. This can be used to recover with ease, but makes the ship Peppy is using vulnerable to be destroyed by ALL attacks.Down B: Fire???Peppy will charge up like Fox and Falco do for their Up Bs, but he will instead just pant in exhaustion. The fire does deal damage, and if he is attacked in this state, he may just charge into you out of nowhere, even if you are at a distance, so keep that in mind.Final Smash: Ship Type B.I.G.Ballistic &amp; Incredible Giant. Peppy will summon a huge ship that will soar around and only stop to send out lasers below, effectively fusing Lucario’s Final Smash with Sonic’s. All the while, Peppy is still on the field, able to attack. Once the Final Smash ends, Peppy’s ships will reset, even if he had more than when he started, so this can be good, and bad.THE FINAL DESTINATION For all of you out there wondering how to sum up how he’s play, let’s say this. Peppy is a luck character. It’s a chance play style in it’s own right. Each of his moves can come out good, or bad, you never know. Having a bit of faith when you start an attack is needed, as you don’t know how it will impact your likely hood to win. It could bite you in the butt, or it could bit you opponents instead. I think something like that is sorely missing in Smash. So, here are all the reasons that we’ve covered for why Peppy should be in Smash.1. A new, all original Star Fox move-set.2. Connection to other characters that can be used for a Story Mode.3. A space general, which is a new twist in Smash.4. Do. A. Barrel. Roll.5. Potential for unique mechanics.With these points combined, they make a full Warp Star for Peppy to make his appearance in Smash Brothers, but what do you guys think? Did I leave something out of the picture? Is it possible? Or do you think it’s unlikely? Leave your thoughts below on if you wanna see Peppy teach Fox, Wolf, and Falco a bit of a history lesson, make sure if you have a character idea to suggest, and I’ll see you guys later."
"So who beats little Mac the *hardest* (semi serious): TLDR: comment your answer/reasoning below! What’s up r/smashbros, I was bored at work and thought it’d be a fun discussion to ask which character wipes the floor hardest with everyone’s (least) favorite boxer.  A few points first: 1) in no way am I suggesting that little Mac is unbalanced or anything other than low tier.  2) little Mac tilts me because (a) he is boring to play against optimally and (b) I rarely if ever practice the matchup so while I understand that I should be reacting and whiff punishing, I’m unused to the openings.  I would like to make this uncommon matchup as brainless for me as humanly possible.  3) I am fairly experienced and can hang with all but the top guys at my locals, picking up a niche secondary would be no big deal.  4) not throwing shade at little Mac players, you guys are fighting the good fight... a lot of us just wish your character didn’t exist (see melee ice climbers) So let’s get started!  One thing everyone brings up in these discussions is edgeguarding, however, because pretty much the entire cast can gimp an offstage little Mac, I think that is a poor consideration in choosing your character against him.  What I would look at instead are the following factors: 1) good grab game.  Little Mac has an (obnoxious) variety of super armor moves, so a good grab goes a long way.  Getting consistent follow ups off of grabs, or better yet, kill confirms, seems like a big deal here.  2) good zoning.  Pretty self explanatory, Mac that can’t get in will be a sad Mac.  3) good combos/kill power.  You don’t want to have to win neutral 10 times to beat mac.  We want a character that punishes hard and closes stocks efficiently.  4)heavy?  With macs kill power I’m honestly not sure how much this matters, but it definitely doesn’t hurt.  Given the above, pikachu and link jump out to me as prime candidates because they each have 3/4 of the above qualities.  Can any mains of these characters comment on the matchup?  Rather than trying to make a wall of text now I figure I’ll see what discussion gets going and join in below.Edit: winning suggestion so far is yoshi.  Extra points if anyone can tell me why that matchup is or isn’t oppressive for little MacEdit 2: yo, what about falco?  Lasers+combo game= profit?"

"Always remember Play-dough: Smash is an amazing game series. Sometimes people get heated about how this game should be played.It should be played however YOU want it to be played. Sakurai says it’s a party game? That’s correct. A pro says it’s a competitive fighter? That’s also correct. Anything in-between is correct, too! The fact that it can be played a gazillion different ways is a testament to its design.I read a bunch of threads recently where people were saying it’s a just party game so everyone should stop caring about winning and just have fun.That’s just like saying no one should play with play-dough because it was originally designed to be wallpaper cleaner.The reverse is just as bad. If you’re a more serious player and chillin with people who are new or just playing for fun, I’d recommend trying out underdog mode or auto handicap, and/or using a character you want to learn how to beat instead of your main. Then you won’t have to sandbag but the rest of the players won’t get bodied every time no matter what.Let’s all play nice with each other in the forums and appreciate that this series we all have a common passion for can in turn be appreciated by so many different people in so many different ways! Smash can bring us together, so let’s not be petty and force each other apart. :)"

"After over a month of getting clips, I finally completed my second K. Rool motage: "
"Joker is Slightly Unbalanced, How Could We Fix Him?: (I posted this to GameFaqs around three weeks ago before patch 3.1 and Joker’s slight buff, so it might not be accurate maybe.)Yes, another Joker is unfair to play against topic.I’m not saying he’s OP, it’s just that some parts of his kit are very infuriating to combat. I feel as if his tether recovery is a part of what makes Joker somewhat unfun to play against. Why? It’s just that Joker can be very close to being offscreen below the platform and still recover, but other characters have to be near the same x-axis as the ledge or with the case of Ivysaur, being fairly close to it since his up-b’s range is pretty terrible. I just feel like Joker shouldn’t have a recovery that good without Arsene. A fix is as easy as shrinking the grapple so it is still a very good tether, just not the greatest recovery.Second thing I can see is the Arsene charge time and duration. Look, Joker has low killing power, everyone who makes these topics hears that one line in their nightmares. However, Joker can get Arsene in a few seconds just by doing a down-b and blocking a few hits. Yes, it has a ton of endlag, but some endlag is pretty low risk to be able to KO on ledge at around 60%, especially if the Joker is already at a fairly low percent and can take that damage.Duration is another fairly strong thing about Arsene. Arsene can stay for as long as 30-40 seconds if Joker is not attacked, while Cloud’s limit break, which has more risk while charging it and takes longer to charge, mind you, lasts 15 seconds, only affects his 4 special moves and his movement speed, and it disappears once he uses a special move. Arsene gives Joker buffs to all of his attacks, takes a fraction of the time to charge completely while using the down-b, and makes Joker take no knockback and half damage. Now yes, while Joker has Arsene, he loses a big chunk of the bar when he takes damage, but Cloud, again, a similar character, loses the entire bar when he takes enough damage. And again, Cloud’s limit doesn’t affect as many things as Joker’s Rebellion does.How would I fix the Arsene problem? I would give the Rebellion’s Guard down-b super armor like Little Mac’s neutral B, where if Joker is hit by a move that does, I don’t know, 10-15% damage, he’ll be given knockback, but get the charge and the half-damage. This way, people can then follow after Joker and continue attacking him, and so that joker can’t just tank a fully charged Bowser fsmash at 100%. As for duration, just lower it to maybe 25-35 seconds and make taking damage slightly more punishing to the rebellion gaugeYes, Joker is not overpowered, but he’s actually just overwhelming to fight against. However, I still think we should wait at least another month or two to see if he TRULY needs these nerfs. I don’t actually know if he is unbalanced, I’m not in Elite Smash and I’m not some top competitive player like eSam or Zero, I was just putting my ideas out there.TL;DR (MY OPINIONS BTW)Joker’s tether should be slightly shorterJoker should take knockback while using Rebellion’s guard if the attack does high enough damage, but still get charge and half-damage. (Think Little Mac charge punch)Arsene’s duration should be shorter and taking damage while in JoJo form should lower the gauge more.Thanks for reading! Please tell me if I’m an idiot for thinking this, and if you have any better ideas."

Little Mac Combo Video/Montage: 
"""Dark Sheep"" - The First Project Plus Combo Video!: "
"One of the best subtle changes from Sm4sh to Ultimate is... cheating.: ...Not the hacking term, but the acting term. ""Cheating"" refers to when actors face their bodies toward the audience during a theatrical performance. This results in body positions during conversations that would normally be awkward, but allow the audience to see their full body language (and hear them better).In Sm4sh (and the games preceding it), many of the fighters face straight forward (https://imgur.com/a/YdsbbmW), which would be normal for fighters, but makes it hard for the audience to see them. In Ultimate, the fighters are angled more toward the screen (https://imgur.com/a/z6nlVWx), letting us see the characters' faces better! Many of these are less subtle than Mario, but they make a huge difference."

The rulesets problem still hasn’t been fixed with a patch. I still get random rulesets every now and again. Mainly 1-2 stocks and a low timer. How come every big game you get people complaining about something to make the game better and the devs listen yet when anyone makes a negative post on here that’s trying to fix the game the mods just delete it? Should the devs of this game be allowed to just ignore fan feedback that isn’t just kissing there ring holes?"
"Decided to make a Roy montage, any good Roy players out there got any criticisms?: "
"Does anyone hate what Lucas has turned into in Ultimate?: I played a lot of Lucas in 4, and I really dug his neutral that was very inviting to go in at certain times in the form of zairing, going for a grab, or nairing all over the place, while being able to retreat with PK fire and use PK thunder as a potential get away tool, especially when someone else was offstage to pressure them.Now Lucas's playstyle just seems... avoidant. It feels like there's nothing encouraging him to get closer to an opponent because all of his grab combos were neutered. With the buffs to PK fire and PK freeze, it seemed like Ultimate Lucas turned into a campy character that is polarizing against characters with bad recoveries, without the semi decent neutral in Smash 4 being passed onto him."
I was playing with stage hazards off but apparently that doesn't count: 
"Before Hero, none of the swordfighters used a katana: Just a quick observation I made.    Oddly enough, all of the sword fighters among Smash's 70+ lineup never use a katana, the most revered (and arguably overrated) weapons in history. Especially strange since it's so iconic and so many characters use them at one point.    This all changed when Hero came along. Specifically [Eight, the bandana-wearing protagonist of Dragon Quest 8.](https://smashboards.com/attachments/1560273004136-png.227318/) His sword of choice for Smash, the [Dragovian King Sword,](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonquest/images/a/ac/DQVIII_-_Dragovian_king_sword.png/revision/latest?cb=20170902221449) is undeniably a katana. So odd that it took this long for one to be used in Smash."

"There is an argument to be made that Armada was really the player that was “killing” melee: Not to throw shade or downplay anyone’s victories at all but...Mid tiers winning supermajors was not a thing that would ever have occurred under Armada’s reign.Also I speculate that Hbox lost some of his determination to prove that he was the best in the world once Armada stepped away.It’s obviously a more complicated situation than that, and I truly hope Armada decides to come back to singles soon.

If it connects it will trap a opponet in a small pillar of fire dealing consant damage intill they escape or the pillar goes away. its a annoying move but dont lean on it to spam to much as its readable and once they know its coming its easy to dodge.&amp;#x200B;PK Flash/Pulse (Neutral B(it depends on what you hear)) One of nesses hardest hitting moves but also one of his worst. When used the move will arc forward from nesses head increasing in power the longer its out and will explode if the B button is released. This move hits very hard if it hits dealing about 30%, note the word IF, the move is very slow and 90% of the time you will get punished for using it. only use it if you can get a edge guard or if your oppenets shield is broken and even then ness has much bette edge guard and punish tools&amp;#x200B;PK Thunder 1 (Up B without hitting Ness) this is one part of nesses Up B. ness will be unable to move while your using it and leave you completly open however it can kill off the top and the tail can gimp people&amp;#x200B;PK Thunder 2 (Up B and hit Ness) if you aim the PK thunder ball at Ness and hit him it will send him forward dealing massive damage to anyone who is hit and its his main recover tool. however characters who can absorb projectiles can take it from ness and ness will go into fall state and just die. whats more if you hit someone midair ness will lose almost all speed he had and just die..again. you can PK thunder again after using it once by teching off the side of the stage or something but i dont know how. ness is also invincible until the move ends&amp;#x200B;PK Magnet (down B) one of nesses best and worst moves. worst in terms of damage as it deals only 1 however its a wind box and air stalls once if used in midair. it also will absorb ANY energy based projectile as well as snakes missle and C4...but only snakes for some reason&amp;#x200B;Up and Down smash: they are special as they have a hitbox when charging. and you can put them at the ledge awhile charging and stop someone from grabbing it and possibly kill them. down smash is better for this as it sends out and away while up smash sends up however both work&amp;#x200B;Back throw: ok how the FUCK did i forget about the legendary backthrow?! This move is GODLY. its been killing sence the first smash game and is the best backthrow in smash history rivaled only by incinaroars. it starts killing at around 100 and ALWAYS kills at 120. if you find yourself desperate for a kill or find another ness desperate for a kill backthrow is the awnser. depending on the situation either get a grab or avoid it at all costs!&amp;#x200B;F-throw: This is a good throw and BROKEN on walkoffs. this thing has all base knockback meaning it will launch the same distance if your opponent is at 0% or 999%. simply walk to the blast zone and f-throw. boom. dead&amp;#x200B;down tilt: a fast kick that can be used in sussesion very fast. if you can get a good set up it can break a full shield.&amp;#x200B;i know theres better guides outthere and im not gonna pretend i know everything there is to know about ness but i hope you all learned something"
"My re-redone moveset for Steve in Smash: Mario and Kirby is fighting Link and Pikachu then a Nether Portal spawns out of nowhere and then they walk into it and they teleport into the Minecraft World and in there new Minecraft form they look around then it turns to night where there surrounded by mobs then it says on the bottom left it says ""Steve joins the Smash"" then Steve comes out of nowhere dashes in and then it says Steve In The Game And Won't Die and defeats all the mobs then cuts to game footageSteve is a middleweight with average speed and 2 average jumps and can crawlBasic Attacks:Jab: A 3 punch jab with 2 punches and 1 final Diamond Pickaxe swing Dash Attack: A jumping slash with the Diamond SwordForward Tilt: The classic swing with the Diamond Sword doing 8% of damageUp Tilt: The upward swing in MinecraftDown Tilt: The classic swing while crouching, but it sends you upwardsNair: The classic swing, but he doesn't stop, so it spins around him.

You don't start with all these items though you get them by using your moves like. When using the dair and getting gravel there's a 1/6 chance when it despawns it will drop a piece of flint that Steve can use to make Flint and Steel, after using his Up Smash there is a 1/20 chance of it dropping an apple, after using his down throw there is a 1/20 chance of it dropping a chorus fruit, after using a dirt block it has a 1/30 chance of it having snow on it and when it breaks it will drop snowballs, after using obsidian if it breaks it has a 1/10 chance of it having lava that will be picked up by Steve with a bucket. That was long.Side B: He will use his Bow which is a lot slower then Toon Link's bow, but is more powerful and arcable and if you move the control stick backward he'll change to the Crossbow which can't be arch but shots are stronger and faster but with more lag if you move the stick left upwards he throws the Splash Potion of Harming which does not knockback but a lot of damage if you move the stick left downwards he'll use a Splash Potion of Poison which he throws downward which does little knockback and poisons for a few secondsUp B: Steve throws an Ender Pearl teleports upwards then blast forwards with fireworks and an Elytra working like Meta Knight Up BFinal Smash: Steve has 3 Final Smashes the 1st one you have to not have a Flint and Steel if you get this one it turns to night with Zombies flooding the stage, Spider speeding around the stage, Skeletons shooting arrows, and Creepers blowing up for the 2nd one you need a Flint and Steel and a Water Bucket a Nether Portal sucking up nearby opponents were the opponents are blasted by beast of the Nether the 3rd one you need every item were the End Portal were opponent will be sucked up like Zelda's Final Smash and if opponent are sucked they get attack by The Ender Dragon resulting in a insist ko even at 0%Taunts:Entrance: Steve spawns in to the battlefield and on the bottom left it says ""Steve joins your world""Idle Animation: Steve switch the weapon in his hand ( This doesn't change any attack it's just visual ) Side Taunt: Steve holds a torch lighting up the battlefield for a few seconds                                           Up Taunt: Steve uses a Diamond Hoe then tills the ground or a dirt block which will grow some wheat after a couple of minutes unless it gets touch in anyway possible then it gets destroyedDown Taunt: Steve drinks a Potion of Invisibility turning invisible for a few seconds then turns backAlternate Colors: 1st: Steve2nd: Steve with dark green hair and shirt and black shoes3rd: Steve with light green hair shirt green pants black shoes4th: Steve with Pink shirt and pants with black shoes5th: Alex6th: Alex with a Cyan shirt and orange pants7th: Alex with a white shirt and blue pants8th: Alex with white hair brown shirt yellow pantsKirby Hat: Kirby in a blocky formWin Screen:Win Screen 1: Steve rides in a Minecart and blast forwards with his wolf in a separate Minecart right behind himWin Screen 2: Steve goes inside his house with his wolf scratching on the windowWin Screen 3: Steve's in a cave and mines a diamond ore and in the background with floating heartsWin Music: CatItem: Diamond Armor if spawned it continues to spawn different pieces if you get all of it you take no damage or knockback for a certain amount of hits depending on the armorAssist Trophy: Creeper: Works like Voltorb, but can't be thrown and walks aroundStage: New World spawns a random stage layout like Mario Maker stage full of breakable blocks and at night mobs attack you Playstyle:Zoner/All-Around Brawler/Trapper"

[SATIRE] Report: White House Aides Did Not Brief Trump About Banjo-Kazooie for Smash: 
"⚠️Friendly reminder⚠️: There will always be people that are better than you in Smash. They could be 15 years old. They could be female. They could spend less time practicing than you, or more time. They could be good-looking, swole, successful in their career. Life isn't fair and sometimes people are just better than you at something.Don't make Smash your identity. Don't make Smash your only source of dopamine. Shower. Go outside. Enjoy other hobbies besides Smash. You'll be happier for it. You'll enjoy the game more and improve more when each loss isn't personal. Trust me.I feel like a lot of the toxicity in the community comes from this redemption of self-worth. ""Well my life may suck this way, but at least I'm good at Smash!"" Stop. It's a game. There's a very small chance of you becoming nationally competitive. It's not worth the controller-throwing, the REEEEs, the insults, the beefs. Respect the game. Respect the players. But most importantly, respect yourself."

"If the 78 day development cycle theory holds any water, Nintendo should be releasing a trailer for Hero sometime today.: [The theory I'm referring to is this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/bzryeh/my_theory_is_even_more_possible_now/)It highlights a pattern in Nintendo's development cycle regarding Smash Ultimate where there is a period of 78 days (11 weeks + 1 day) between character releases (Joker was released 78 days after Piranha Plant). There is only one sample of this so it is not much of a pattern, but tonight/tomorrow will confirm or deconfirm this theory.One additional thing to note is that the 78 day development cycle will align perfectly with release dates for future characters and end exactly when Nintendo said the DLC Fighter Pass will end (February 2020). These dates are:**Banjo: September 20****Fighter #4: December 7** (also coincidentally the same day Ultimate was released in 2019, but likely irrelevant)**Fighter #5: February 23** (per Nintendo: ""Fighters Pass content is available as it is released. All sets will be released through the end of February 2020."")On April 16th at 9pm EST Nintendo released a [reveal trailer](https://youtu.be/W4PG9qx9x2s) for Joker a day before the official patch with his inclusion was available to download. Knowing this, it is probable that they will also release a character spotlight trailer prior to **Hero releasing on July 4th** should the theory hold any water.Expect this trailer sometime tonight or tomorrow. If we are lucky Hero will be playable sometime tomorrow."
"WarioWare's Legality: This has been touched upon numerous times, but I am here to set the record straight, cut through the crap and give some real answers as to where WarioWare stands on the competitive stage list in Super Smash Bros Ultimate.**1. Where should WarioWare be on the stage list?**This stage should be a legal singles counterpick. This is also been the case in other platform fighters, namely Project M, Super Smash Flash 2, Yoshi's Story in Melee, and RockWall in Rivals of Aether is a counterpick. It should only be legal in singles since the main stage is too small for doubles to make sense and a counterpick since it is too polarizing to be a starter.**2. What does/would WarioWare offer?**This stage would provide a unique platform layout, no other stage has the same one with four platforms, two resembling the right and left platform on Battlefield except right over the ledge, and two smaller platforms, right above the other two. It also has no moving platforms, no slants, and no randomness to prevent it from being legalized (hazards off of course).**3. Why should it be legal at all?**When talking with others about WarioWare, there are a few problems that people have mentioned with the stage. I asked around on twitter and here's what I've got from others:**1.** **It has a very high ceiling.**This is a very common misunderstanding, and for good reason too. [This](https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/1140672650123104262/1140672631663996929/VkDQxsVl.jpg:large) demographic, credits to @Ruben\_dal for the stage data information, shows that WarioWare's ceiling is 210 as opposed to most legal stages 192. Yet the difference is extremely minimal, and I'll show you why.  [This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nvByE87-3apkRC98jZEmzPIyG5Ozm1H7ZCJIX2mKQkg/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet shows that WarioWare's initial stage doesn't start at zero, but instead at 12. This means instead of 210 units, it's actually 198 units, main stage to the blast zone. This doesn't make much of a difference in the game as Mario's Up Smash kills 2 percent later than on Battlefield, or at least according to this[ video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuqDx6IZ4nI)**2. The platform layout allows for simple and easy juggles.**The platform layout has worked in past games, as the aforementioned PM and SSF2 WarioWare and RockWall in Rivals of Aether. The two top platforms are also the same height as the middle platform on Battlefield. The platform layout just works, I don't really know what else to say other than it's been tested and it has been proven to work.**3. It is too polarizing for certain characters, even for a counterpick.**We can do a comparison to other stages that have also been very polarizing. Think Marth on Final Destination in Melee, or Zero Suit Samus on triplat stages in Smash 4, or Greninja on Final Destination in Ultimate. All of these examples show that just as polarizing stages have existed in past games. Turns out certain characters or playstyles do well on certain stages, who would have guessed. WarioWare is also supposed to be a counterpick, as in it is supposed to give an advantage to your character and not to your opponent.**4. Our standards for stage legalization is higher, why deal with it?**This is totally right! Our standards are a lot higher for stages. We don't have to deal with clone stages like Dreamland or Midgar, or transforming stages like Delfino Plaza, and we even can turn the hazards off for Unova, Pokemon Stadium 1 and 2, Kalos, and Lylat Cruise. WarioWare is nowhere near as bad as these previous stages mentioned. On WarioWare, you don't have to fight against the stage at all since it throws nothing unfair at you.**5. Why bother with a stage that will just always be banned?**Ban rate has almost nothing to do with stage legalization. If this were the case, then Final Destination would be banned, it didn't see a single top 8 game during Genesis 6, yet it's a starter. When looking at a stage to be legalized, it should be from an objective point of view, not an ""I don't like the stage and it should be banned everywhere"".**6. The side blastzones are too close (This is the biggest one obviously).**The meat and potatoes of this whole stage is probably right here. My main point in all of this is that just as small stages have existed in other platform fighters or smash games. It is also good to remember that dying earlier also means killing earlier. For example, It is much easier and noticeable to say ""I died to this move because of WarioWare"" than ""I lived to this move because of Pokemon Stadium 2"". I for one prefer having faster games, but to each their own. Without further ado, the data. WarioWare is, mathematically speaking, around 25 percent smaller than Battlefield.  [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/a3aid1/warioware_is_this_games_yoshis_story_frame_data/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), spreadsheet included, shows that Yoshi's Story in Melee is also around 25 percent smaller than Battlefield.  [This post](https://imgur.com/a/XKg9V), with a different spreadsheet, also shows that WarioLand, or WarioWare in Project M, was also around 25 percent smaller than its version of Battlefield. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find anything on stage blastzone data for Super Smash Flash 2, since it is not as well known. I did some very primitive comparisons though between games. Mario's forward smash kills Mario at 58 at the ledge on Yoshi's Story, 61 on WarioWare, 66 on Battlefield, and 74 on Dreamland in SSF2. Mario's forward smash kills Mario at 56 at the ledge on WarioWare, 67 on Town and City, 72 on Battlefield, and 74 on Kalos in Ultimate. The percentages look similar, but either way, SSF2 contains smaller than average stages. If two different game engines (counting Project M and Melee as one game engine here), can both have smaller than average stages, why can't a third? No, Project M is not a fake game, there are still tournaments being held and Project Plus continues to advance it even further. Super Smash Flash 2, while not as well known, is a great game and I encourage everybody here to give it a go. Also, check out BowlerSSF2 and Sherwood for some SSF2 content.&amp;#x200B;TLDR: Just as small stages have existed in the past, and it would still be even. It also isn't as small as some make it out to be.&amp;#x200B;Conclusion: LEGALIZE WARIOWARE AS A LEGAL SINGLES COUNTERPICK"
Cool combo I did with Bayonetta that I'm proud of: 
"Bocchi abandoning her account/tag, probably leaving the community.: "
"Bocchi and Etika: A Solution-Focused Approach: Etika and Bocchi are two recent, biting examples of a very long-standing problem that the gaming space (smash more specifically in these instances) has had in regards to respect, manners, and etiquette within this community.  The thing is though, I look around and I see a lot of problem-focused individuals just as much as apathy or mouthpieces for the status quo.  Each time a story like this breaks it seems like there's a wave of thoughts and prayers alongside cries of ""That's just how it is.""  I'm not an expert here, I'm not gonna pretend like I can change the world here, but shouldn't we as a community consider coming together and collaborating on ways to make these issues better?  Shouldn't the suicide of a major content creator loved by his fans be an impetus to think about treatments for this problem?  I'm just a no-name player that goes 2-2 at his local; are there more influential people we can recruit to begin taking action and incentivizing better behavior?&amp;#x200B;Again, I don't wanna sit here and start spouting out all the ways that we can fix this provided tens of thousands of people get on board, I'm well aware of the social reach a Reddit post can make, even should this reach the front page.  This thread is here to start a dialogue that hopefully others can chime in on with ideas of ways we can make things better.  Maybe there's a group, a club of some kind where all members pledge to be kind and respectful on and off the sticks.  Maybe some TOs can provide positive incentives for competitors: comical as it is, bring a stick of deodorant, get a discount on your venue fee.  Little ideas like this that start small and start simply with the potential to make some good change given enough traction.  If people have ideas, any ideas at all, let's discuss them.  I, and many will probably agree, don't want to wait until the next smasher/content creator offs themselves because of the inescapable toxicity these communities foster.  Let's start working together on ways we can make this space better for everyone.&amp;#x200B;As an added note, if you want to come into this thread and say this kind of change is impossible, that toxicity is inevitable and there's nothing we can do to change or improve it, please just don't post that reply.  We all understand what the current situation is; we all know the problems toxicity causes and how difficult it is to make meaningful change.  To come in here, or on any post related to these topics and say ""That's the way things are"" only serves to normalize this current state of affairs and validates everyone who doesn't want to do anything about it.  Shouldn't we all collectively want the best for this and many other communities?  Shouldn't we strive to make this welcoming and inclusive for everyone?&amp;#x200B;This wall of anonymity that the internet presents us with has long invited bad actors to abuse it for the sake of no consequences for their actions.  They can say whatever vile, evil, horrendous words they want to whomever with little to no repercussions.  Bad actors like these are causing good people to take their own lives, and to leave the spaces they very well could have called home.  Should we really still wear that lack of accountability like a badge of honor?  Should we continue to turn our heads?&amp;#x200B;Like I said above, any and all ideas are welcome to be discussed here.  I think we should start putting some serious thought into how we can make this a better space for everyone.  My DMs are open, and I am beyond willing to help out in any way I can."
"WarioWare’s Illegality: **A lot of people have been rallying behind a post encouraging the legalization of WarioWare. While I respect the opinions of these people, I’m going to have to disagree.** I’m going to counter some of the points made by people who want this stage legalized. Hear me out on this one.**1. “There aren’t enough legal stages that benefit more offensive/aggressive characters.”**If we look at *CEO and EVO’s stage list,* there are nine stages. **Four of them generally benefit more defensive play, whether it’s due to stage size or platform layout.** Those being Kalos League, FD, PS2 (which is debatable), and Town &amp;amp; City. **There are four more stages that generally benefit offensive play, whether it’s due to stage size or platform layout once again.** Those are Smashville, Battlefield, and the two Yoshi stages. Then, there’s Lylat, which is a mixed bag. It’s a wide stage that can potentially encourage defensive play, but it also has slopes and platforms.So, **if we look at what’s currently legal in the largest tournaments this summer, it seems to me that our stage list is already pretty balanced.** Adding WarioWare isn’t exactly necessary. It’s not solving any problems.**2. “WarioWare would give benefits to aggressive characters that other stages don’t give.”****WarioWare’s small size would force people into playing defensive.** You make one mistake, and it’s all over for you if you’re at enough percent. This means that defensive characters would actually thrive off of this stage. Especially considering that the unorthodox platform layout means that standing by the edge and throwing out projectiles can actually be a much more viable strategy here. *Just think of how Snake already enjoys platform control on Battlefield, and then multiply that.***Also, some characters like Yoshi are actually fast enough in the air to potentially camp out slower characters.** This is because of how the two upper platforms are not only far away from the ground, but they’re far apart from each other. Although, they’re just close enough for people to viably platform camp.**I can honestly imagine heavies struggling on this stage more than on a stage like Yoshi’s Story or Smashville,** to be completely honest.**3. WarioWare was legal in Project M, why not in Ultimate?”**The funny thing about this, is that WarioWare’s small size was so jank that they had to resize it to make it equal to Yoshi’s Story’s size (in Melee).**4. “Yoshi’s Story was legal in Melee, despite being almost as small. Why can’t WarioWare be legal in Ultimate?”**In Melee, losing a stock doesn’t have as much value compared to Ultimate. This is mainly due to having one more stock than Ultimate. Melee is also a fast-paced game that has a lot of quick kills (f.e. go watch Westballz when he’s having a good performance), so **Yoshi’s Story compliments the spirit of Melee almost perfectly.** WarioWare doesn’t really do that for Ultimate, so its legality becomes much more problematic due to that.(Shoutouts to u/voll_ssb) Melee also has much stronger and more influential DI, which means that survivability on Yoshi’s Story in Melee is arguably better than WarioWare in Ultimate.**5. “We should at least experiment with its legality.”**(Shoutouts to u/try1x) This stage was actually legalized early on in Ultimate’s life. One of the first big Ultimate tournaments, Don’t Park On The Grass, had it legalized. However, people did not like the stage that much.It was also legal in Xanadu weeklies for a long time, and due to this, was legal in the largest pre-Genesis Ultimate tournament (Glitch 6). It was also a stage most competitors disliked, so it was banned."

"Worst tournament sets in Smash history.: Since I’m a masochist, I want to binge watch some of the worst competitive Smash that has ever been played.

I already know about a few:-Lima vs CaptainZack, Smash 4 EVO 2018-Chango vs Fauxhebro, Melee Battle of BC 3-Chris Best vs net1234, Melee EVO 2016"

"An honest question.: Hey all. I’m a 16 year old Asian kid. My friends and I really want to go to this one local because we don’t have to rely on our parents since I can drive now. However, we are being hesitant due to recent news. One of my friends have been to a local before and he was made fun of for his race and he said it smelled bad. So the honest question is, are these standards everywhere?"

Some of my Isabelle highlights. And a special treat for those who have a personal vendetta against Lucas dairs lol: 
"How would you significantly shake up the next Smash?: It feels like Ultimate is the culmination of a general philosophy up to this point going something like, ""always increase the number of fighters and keep existing characters' moves 90% the same as their previous appearances."" Unfortunately it's kind of hard to imagine this trend continuing indefinitely or even past Ultimate, so I've been trying to imagine a hypothetical re-booted or bizarro version for the next Smash game. The only two examples I can think of are villain-based, where Wario and Waluigi are the main mascots and antagonists are prioritized for inclusion, and one in which the familiar core roster is back but with moves designed from scratch. I'm not saying I'm super into these ideas, I just wonder if eventually something like this will happen."

"[Speculation] By going off the news section, we may be getting a new update sooner than we think: First off, this is obviously just speculation on my part, and none of what I'm saying is set in stone by any means. I just felt this was super interesting to look into and hopefully spark some discussion.Now I believe that, by using the amount of post between each Version, We may be getting a new update as early as this week. I also believe that they are planning on keeping a schedule of **5 to 6 News Post per Update.** Below I've listed the amount of post made between each new Update/Version:VERSION 1.1.0 to VERSION 1.2.0 = 4 News PostVERSION 1.2.0 to VERSION 1.2.1 =1 News PostVERSION 1.2.1 to VERSION 2.0.0 = **6 News Post**VERSION 2.0.0 to VERSION 2.0.1 = **5 News Post**VERSION 2.0.1 to VERSION 2.0.2 = **6 News Post**\*VERSION 2.0.2 to VERSION 3.0.0 = 10 News Post (4 Regular Post and 6 Post regarding the Joker Release + Mii Costumes)\*VERSION 3.0.0 to VERSION 3.0.1 = 3 News Post (2 more posts regarding the Mii Costumes  and 1 Regular Post)VERSION 3.0.1 to VERSION 3.1.0 = **6 News Post****\*I'm only disregarding Version 1.1.0 to Version 1.2.1 because this could have been the devs figuring out a decent post schedule themselves since the game had just come out. As for Version 2.0.2 to Version 3.0.1, There's a total of 5 regular posts between these updates, and the rest of the Joker + Mii Costume info is just its own thing.**Now, Only a few hours ago before me posting this, The 6th News Post ( an event) has gone up, which leads me to believe we may be getting an Update either this week or next week. I have no idea whether it will be a 3.2.0 update or a major 4.0.0 update, but using what I've gathered from the News Section, I have a strong feeling we'll be getting an Update of some sort.Once again, this is just me speculating and using what I have to stir up some discussion and build some hype for the possibility that a new update will be coming soon!"

"What are the best teams?: I really like teams and want to share my own opinion and see what you all think. Keep in my mind, almost every team has a counter or struggles against certain characters so this list is ordered on how well the team stands up against all teams, holistically speaking. There will be a few ties. My list: 1. Fox and Falco (Team Starfox). Fox and Fox (Team 20xx).Starfox-While they lack the kill power that Double fox has, this team makes up for it in combos, stage control and even long range saves all of which are provided by Falco. This team is not countered by any team although they can struggle against double fox, marth, Peach, and sheik. 20xx This one is fairly obvious. Fox is a crazy character. This team is one of the best at getting kills and surviving for a long time. Is also one of the most versatile teams as they can kill with up smash and up-air and edge-guard effectively with back air and shine. While technically the best team, this team is also very hard to play at a consistently solid performance level. 2. Fox and Jigglypuff (The Power Couple) Possibly the team with the most killpower. (Rest and Upsmash). Puff and Fox Complement each other very well as fox and control the ground and Puff the air. Puff also excels at saving fox and comboing off of fox’s moves into an edge guard or rest. Very few teams counter this team except maybe the teams listed above. 3. Sheik and Peach (Team Dummy Thwack). This team has an insane combo game and high survivability. While they struggle against double puff and perhaps double fox in some cases, they are a solid team and have few weaknesses. They lack in killpower and if separated can struggle. But their ability to rack up crazy amounts of damage remains their biggest asset and allows them to change the tides. Plus, their double downsmash always remains a formidable force, especially against spacies.4. Fox and Sheik (The Speedsters) Fox and Peach (The Cute Couple) Speedsters Fox and sheik are a formidable team and have the contention to be one of the best teams in the game. However, both of these characters get comboed fairly easily and can struggle to save one another. However, their speed and kill power remains relatively unmatched by any other team outside of fast fallers. The Cute Couple Basically the same reasons puff and fox are good, however Peach obviously has a ground game that puff lacks. This team can work well when either party is on the offensive, with fox’s aggression and Peach’s high pressure aerials. This team struggles most when Peach is knocked away and fox gets 2 v 1’d. This team has several counters especially on big stages if the Peach is ganged up on by faster characters. 5. Marth and Fox (Space Sword) This team has some very unique combos and pressure strings. Marth is one of the best support characters in teams and as usual, fox remains one of the best team mates to have, offering pressure and kill power to aid Marth’s ability to wall, create space and find grabs which can lead into combos. Marth can struggle against several characters such as puff, peach, falcon, and sheik in teams, however his ability to wall with fox’s support can render these threats ineffective. 6. Falcon and Falco (Team Big Dick Energy) Falcon is one of the few characters in which fox is NOT his best teammate. Falco’s ability to save with lasers from a distance when Falcon is off stage keeps this team viable. Their insane combo game and ability to kill early is hard for many teams to deal with. Falcon’s ability to wall out characters such as puff and Marth and Peach allow for Falco to survive and play more of a support role. However, either of these characters can go in or play support in any given time. Their ability to rack up damage and get quick kills is rivaled only by double spacies and peach and sheik. A very solid team. 7. Puff and Falco (Balloon Bird) Peach and Falco (Pink Bird) Balloon Bird The high aerial play involved allows both characters to excel at their combo game. Puff can go for rests and be saved at a distance by falco’s lasers. This team struggles of separated but can be very difficult to penetrate when they are walling successfully. Pink Bird Falco offers support with lasers and platform pressure while Peach stays grounded and centered and goes for edge guards. Falco is a better support role for this team as he is vulnerable at ledge but the roles can be switched as well. A strong team. I think from here the list gets very contentious. 8. Double Puff. (Team Bair) This team can be very hard to deal with and while they can struggle with all of the teams listed above apart maybe from Sheik and Peach, their ability to find kills, edge-guard, and stall can counter many teams comprised of floating characters or characters who are easy to edgeguard, such as falcon. 9. Falcon and Fox (Team Racers), Marth and Sheik (Team Beard, Double Sheik (Team Ninja) Double Peach (Team Downsmash), Marth and Peach (Team Royalty) Double Falco (Bird Gang)All oddball teams with varied kill setups. all of these teams are underexplored but have potential to be good, however they can get countered fairly easily by teams with higher killpower or teams that separate and egdeguard the pair. 10. Pikachu and Yoshi (Team aMSa/Axe) Puff and ICs (just big hitboxes)aMSa/axe Not a bad team, but gets hard countered by puff and spacies. Strangely have good chemistry together. Puff and ICsNot a great team but complement each other in some departments. With ICs patrolling the ground and puff the air, this team can rack up damage and establish control. Especially if puff is able to get a rest off of ICs grabs. Obvious hard counters are Falcon, Peach, Fox, and even Marth and Yoshi. Well that’s my list. Would love to see all of your lists!"

"I think I’m encountering “Smash Block” and I’m unsure what to do.: Just a little about myself, the first Smash I owned was Smash 4. I played pretty causally and didn’t really get into competitive until Ultimate. Since launch it’s been a constant struggle for me. Fortunately, my friend has been helping me along the way since he’s a very experienced player. However, what’s been a struggle for me since day one was something I couldn’t quite find the word to describe until now, and that’s “Smash Block”. Whenever I play a match with someone, whether it be friendlies or in a tournament, I feel like my mind just goes blank. I’m not sure if it’s bad nerves or what, but it’s awful. It’s like each time I’m given a blank canvas, but no ideas come to mind. I often just play reactively and seemingly on full autopilot. It’s not defensive, because that would imply I am anticipating and countering what I encounter, but I am not. This is the same feeling I’d get when I would start a race in track or cross country. As soon as the gun went off, my mind shut off and I just went. There’s no conviction or purpose in any of the moves I make. For example, I could be nowhere near my opponent and I’ll do a short hop aerial. I’ve spent countless hours watching guides, pros play, and practicing with my friend. But as soon as I get into a match, it’s all gone. There’s no plan, no ideas as to what to do. Just me choosing randomly from my assortment of known options. I feel like I’m losing my mind. It’s frustrating because outside of a match I know what I should try to do, but in a match it’s like I don’t and I’m conscious of this all. Has anyone else had this problem? Or am I just going insane?"

"Let's Talk About Keemstar's Smash Tournament: For those of you not in the loop, Keemstar has been running events for various games (currently Fortnite and Minecraft) and has previously considered possibly running a smash tournament. In the wake of Etika's unfortunate passing, Keemstar received a lot of negative attention for the way in which he treated the entire Etika situation (read: https://twitter.com/Captianfalcon11/status/1143900270633672704). Keemstar has decided to create a smash tournament to supposedly honor Etika (https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1143634330318778369) and has since moved on to asking for suggestions of people he would like to invite. Notably, popular smash content creators such as Tempo Zero (he has since deleted his tweet about the tournament) reached out to Keemstar to offer support. Outside of his involvement with Etika, Keemstar is known to be a very polarizing figure in the community that has been engaged in way more than his fair share of conflict (watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVXebiZuxXY ). In fact, a popular Minecraft YouTuber has recently left Keemstar's Minecraft event. He claims this is because he cannot support what Keemstar as a person in good faith. On the other hand however, fans of Etika know that he loved Keemstar and loved Drama Alert. If Keemstar were to have hosted a smash tournament a few months ago, it’s very possible that Etika would have been hyped up and excited. With all of this in mind, do you all think it is appropriate for the community, especially heavy hitters such as ZeRo and Samsora, to support a tournament like this? Personally, my opinion can be summed up with this (posted before ZeRo decided to join Keemstar's tournament): https://twitter.com/zerowondering/status/1143571668796944384"
